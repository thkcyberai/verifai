This explanation is well-supported by scientific understanding of meteorological phenomena."
418,1,418,Scientific,Medium,Rain is caused by clouds sweating,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""rain is caused by clouds sweating"" is definitely false. Rain is a result of the condensation of water vapor in the atmosphere, which forms clouds. When the droplets in clouds combine and grow large enough, they fall to the ground as precipitation due to gravity. The process is not analogous to sweating, which is the release of moisture from the pores of living organisms."
419,1,419,Scientific,Medium,Snow is frozen rain,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Snow and frozen rain are different meteorological phenomena. Snow forms when water vapor in clouds freezes directly into ice crystals, which then clump together to form snowflakes. Frozen rain, or sleet, occurs when raindrops freeze into ice pellets before reaching the ground. Therefore, the claim that ""snow is frozen rain"" is likely false."
420,1,420,Scientific,Medium,Hail forms in thunderstorms,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Hail is a type of precipitation that forms in thunderstorms. It occurs when updrafts in the storm carry raindrops upward into extremely cold areas of the atmosphere, where they freeze. The frozen particles can then be carried up and down within the storm, accumulating layers of ice before falling to the ground as hailstones. This process is well-documented in meteorology, making the claim definitely true. Multiple sources support this claim."
421,1,421,Scientific,Medium,The greenhouse effect warms Earth,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The greenhouse effect is a well-established scientific phenomenon where certain gases in Earth's atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, trap heat from the sun. This process warms the planet and is essential for maintaining temperatures that support life. Without the greenhouse effect, Earth would be too cold to sustain most current life forms. This claim is supported by extensive scientific research and is a fundamental concept in climate science. Multiple sources support this claim."

This understanding is supported by extensive scientific research and is a fundamental concept in climate science."
423,1,423,Scientific,Medium,Ozone protects from UV radiation,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ozone protects from UV radiation is definitely true. The ozone layer in Earth's stratosphere absorbs the majority of the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation, particularly UV-B and UV-C rays, which can cause skin cancer and cataracts in humans, as well as harm animals and plants. This protective function of the ozone layer is well-documented and widely accepted in the scientific community."
424,1,424,Scientific,Medium,The ozone layer is in the stratosphere,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,The claim that the ozone layer is in the stratosphere is definitely true. The ozone layer is a region of Earth's stratosphere that contains a high concentration of ozone (O3) and absorbs most of the Sun's ultraviolet radiation. This is a well-established scientific fact. Multiple sources support this claim.
425,1,425,Scientific,Medium,Clouds are made of water vapor,TRUE,FALSE,90.0%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Clouds are primarily composed of tiny water droplets or ice crystals, not water vapor. Water vapor is the gaseous form of water, which is invisible. When water vapor in the atmosphere cools and condenses, it forms the visible droplets or ice crystals that make up clouds."
426,1,426,Scientific,Medium,Fog is a cloud at ground level,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Fog is indeed a cloud that forms at ground level. It consists of tiny water droplets suspended in the air, similar to clouds that form higher in the atmosphere. This definition is widely accepted in meteorology, making the claim definitely true."
427,1,427,Scientific,Medium,Dew forms from condensation,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Dew forms from the process of condensation, which occurs when water vapor in the air cools and changes into liquid water droplets on surfaces. This is a well-established scientific fact."
428,1,428,Scientific,Medium,Frost is frozen dew,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Frost and dew are both forms of condensation, but they form under different conditions. Dew forms when water vapor condenses into liquid droplets on surfaces when temperatures are above freezing. Frost forms when water vapor sublimates directly into ice crystals on surfaces when temperatures are below freezing. Therefore, frost is not frozen dew, as they originate from different processes."
429,1,429,Scientific,Medium,The moon causes ocean tides,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the moon causes ocean tides is well-supported by scientific evidence. The gravitational pull of the moon on the Earth's oceans is the primary force responsible for the creation of tides. This gravitational interaction causes the water to bulge out on the side of the Earth facing the moon and on the opposite side, leading to high and low tides. This phenomenon is a fundamental concept in oceanography and physics, making the claim definitely true. Multiple sources support this claim."
430,1,430,Factual_Easy,Easy,The sun is a planet,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""The sun is a planet"" is definitely false. The sun is classified as a star, specifically a G-type main-sequence star (G2V), and not a planet. Planets are celestial bodies that orbit stars, whereas the sun is the central star of our solar system around which planets, including Earth, orbit. This classification is well-established in astronomy."
431,1,431,Factual_Easy,Easy,The sun is a star,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""The sun is a star"" is scientifically accurate.

434,1,434,Factual_Easy,Easy,Mars is called the Red Planet,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Mars is commonly known as the ""Red Planet"" due to its reddish appearance, which is caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface. This is a well-established fact in astronomy and widely recognized in both scientific literature and popular culture. Multiple sources support this claim."
435,1,435,Scientific,Medium,Venus is the hottest planet,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Venus is indeed the hottest planet in our solar system. Despite Mercury being closer to the Sun, Venus has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, which creates a strong greenhouse effect, trapping heat and raising surface temperatures to an average of about 467 degrees Celsius (872 degrees Fahrenheit). This makes Venus hotter than Mercury, whose average surface temperature is lower due to its lack of a significant atmosphere to retain heat. Multiple sources support this claim."
436,1,436,Factual_Easy,Easy,Mercury is closest to the sun,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Mercury is the innermost planet in our solar system, orbiting closest to the Sun.

442,1,442,Factual_Easy,Easy,Comets have tails,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Comets are known to develop tails when they approach the Sun. The heat from the Sun causes the comet's ice to vaporize and release gas and dust, forming a glowing coma and often two tails: a dust tail and an ion tail. This phenomenon is well-documented and observed in astronomy. Multiple sources support this claim."
443,1,443,Factual_Easy,Easy,Meteors are shooting stars,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""meteors are shooting stars"" is definitely true. In common terminology, a ""shooting star"" refers to the visible streak of light produced when a meteoroid enters the Earth's atmosphere and burns up due to friction with the air. This phenomenon is scientifically known as a meteor. Therefore, the terms ""meteor"" and ""shooting star"" describe the same event."
444,1,444,Factual_Easy,Easy,The Milky Way is our galaxy,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The Milky Way is indeed the galaxy that contains our solar system, including Earth.

445,1,445,Scientific,Medium,Black holes emit light,FALSE,TRUE,90.0%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Black holes themselves do not emit light in the traditional sense because their gravitational pull is so strong that not even light can escape from within the event horizon. However, black holes can emit radiation through a process known as Hawking radiation, which is a theoretical prediction by physicist Stephen Hawking. This radiation is not light in the conventional sense but is a form of electromagnetic radiation. Additionally, the accretion disk of material around a black hole can emit light as it heats up due to friction and gravitational forces. Therefore, while black holes do not emit light directly, they can be associated with light emission through these processes."
446,1,446,Scientific,Medium,The Big Bang created the universe,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model explaining the observable universe's early development. It suggests that the universe expanded from a hot, dense state approximately 13.8 billion years ago. While it describes the universe's evolution from an early state, it does not explain the ultimate origin of the universe itself. Therefore, saying the Big Bang ""created"" the universe is somewhat imprecise, but it is likely true in the context of describing the universe's development from its earliest known state. Multiple sources support this claim."
447,1,447,Scientific,Medium,The universe is expanding,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the universe is expanding is supported by substantial scientific evidence, most notably the observation of the redshift of light from distant galaxies, which indicates they are moving away from us.

574,1,574,Current_Events,Easy,TikTok became the most downloaded app,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"TikTok has been reported as the most downloaded app in various quarters and years, particularly in 2020 and 2021, according to multiple sources like Sensor Tower and App Annie. However, app download rankings can fluctuate frequently, and the claim may not hold true for every specific time period. Therefore, while it is likely true for certain periods, it may not be universally true at all times."
575,1,575,Current_Events,Easy,The metaverse became a tech buzzword,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The term ""metaverse"" has indeed become a tech buzzword, especially following Facebook's rebranding to Meta in 2021 and the increased focus on virtual and augmented reality technologies. The concept has been widely discussed in tech circles, media, and among companies exploring digital and immersive experiences."
576,1,576,Current_Events,Easy,NFTs became popular in 2021,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) gained significant popularity in 2021, with a surge in media coverage, public interest, and market activity. High-profile sales, such as Beeple's digital artwork selling for $69 million, and the involvement of celebrities and major brands contributed to their widespread recognition. This aligns with data and reports from 2021, confirming the claim's accuracy."
577,1,577,Current_Events,Easy,Cryptocurrency crashed in 2022,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"In 2022, the cryptocurrency market experienced significant downturns, with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum losing substantial value. The collapse of Terra's stablecoin and the bankruptcy of major crypto firms like FTX contributed to the market's decline. These events are widely reported and documented, supporting the claim that cryptocurrency ""crashed"" in 2022."
578,1,578,Current_Events,Easy,AI image generation became mainstream in 2022,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"In 2022, AI image generation tools like DALL-E 2, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion gained significant attention and usage, indicating a shift towards mainstream adoption. These tools became widely discussed in media, used by artists and hobbyists, and integrated into various applications, suggesting that AI image generation became more accessible and popular during that year. However, ""mainstream"" can be subjective, so while the claim is likely true, it may not be universally accepted as such."
579,1,579,Current_Events,Easy,Climate protests increased globally,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"There is substantial evidence indicating an increase in global climate protests over recent years. Movements like Fridays for Future, Extinction Rebellion, and others have gained significant traction, leading to widespread demonstrations. Media reports and academic studies have documented a rise in both the frequency and scale of climate-related protests worldwide. However, without specific data quantifying the increase, the assessment remains somewhat generalized, hence the score of 0.7."
580,1,580,Scientific,Medium,Lightning never strikes twice in the same place,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Lightning never strikes twice in the same place"" is a common myth. In reality, lightning can and often does strike the same place multiple times, especially in areas with tall structures or conductive materials. For example, the Empire State Building in New York City is struck by lightning multiple times each year. Therefore, the claim is definitely false."
581,1,581,Myths,Medium,You lose most body heat through your head,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that most body heat is lost through the head is a misconception. Heat loss occurs through any part of the body that is exposed, and the head is not inherently more significant in this regard than other parts of the body. The myth likely originated from a misinterpretation of military studies where subjects were dressed in cold weather gear that left the head exposed, leading to disproportionate heat loss through the head. In reality, heat loss is proportional to the surface area exposed, and the head represents only about 10% of the body's surface area."
582,1,582,Myths,Medium,Cracking knuckles causes arthritis,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Multiple studies have investigated the relationship between knuckle cracking and arthritis, and the consensus in the medical community is that there is no direct link between the two. While habitual knuckle cracking may lead to other issues such as reduced grip strength or hand swelling, it does not cause arthritis. The claim is likely false based on current scientific evidence."
583,1,583,Myths,Medium,Swallowed gum stays in stomach for 7 years,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that swallowed gum stays in the stomach for 7 years is a myth. While gum is not easily digested, it does not remain in the stomach for an extended period. The body moves it through the digestive system and it is eventually excreted in stool. This process typically takes a few days, similar to other indigestible substances."
584,1,584,Scientific,Medium,We only use 10% of our brains,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that we only use 10% of our brains is a myth. Neurological research using brain imaging technologies, such as fMRI and PET scans, shows that we use virtually all parts of our brain, and most of the brain is active almost all the time. Different tasks and activities engage different areas of the brain, but there is no part of the brain that is completely inactive."
585,1,585,Myths,Medium,Sugar makes kids hyperactive,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Multiple scientific studies have investigated the claim that sugar causes hyperactivity in children and have found no significant evidence supporting this idea. The belief that sugar makes kids hyperactive is largely a myth, often attributed to placebo effects or situational factors (e.g., excitement at parties where sugary foods are consumed). The American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations have stated that sugar does not cause hyperactivity."
586,1,586,Myths,Medium,Carrots improve your night vision,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that carrots improve night vision is largely a myth. While carrots are high in beta-carotene, which the body converts into vitamin A, an essential nutrient for maintaining healthy vision, they do not specifically enhance night vision beyond normal levels. The myth originated during World War II as part of British propaganda to explain improved night-time accuracy of pilots, which was actually due to radar technology. Therefore, while carrots contribute to overall eye health, they do not significantly improve night vision."
587,1,587,Myths,Medium,Reading in dim light damages eyes,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that reading in dim light damages eyes is likely false. Scientific evidence suggests that while reading in dim light can cause eye strain and temporary discomfort, it does not cause permanent damage to the eyes. The discomfort usually resolves with rest and proper lighting. This understanding is supported by ophthalmologists and vision experts."
588,1,588,Myths,Medium,Shaving makes hair grow back thicker,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that shaving makes hair grow back thicker is a common myth. Scientific studies have shown that shaving does not change the thickness, color, or rate of hair growth. When hair is shaved, it is cut at the surface, leaving a blunt tip. As the hair grows out, this blunt tip can feel coarser or thicker, but the actual hair structure and growth rate remain unchanged."
589,1,589,Myths,Medium,You need 8 glasses of water daily,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that you need 8 glasses of water daily is a common guideline but not a scientifically established requirement. Individual water needs vary based on factors like age, sex, weight, climate, and physical activity. The ""8x8"" rule (eight 8-ounce glasses) is a general recommendation, but many people get adequate hydration from food and other beverages. Therefore, while it can be a useful guideline for some, it is not universally necessary."
590,1,590,Scientific,Medium,Microwaves cause cancer,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Microwaves are a form of non-ionizing radiation, which means they do not have enough energy to remove tightly bound electrons from atoms or molecules and thus cannot cause cancer by damaging DNA. The primary effect of microwaves is to cause molecules to vibrate, producing heat. There is no scientific evidence supporting the claim that microwaves cause cancer. The consensus among health organizations, including the World Health Organization, is that microwaves used in microwave ovens are safe when used according to the manufacturer's instructions."
591,1,591,Scientific,Medium,Vaccines cause autism,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Extensive scientific research has shown no causal link between vaccines and autism. The claim originated from a discredited study by Andrew Wakefield, which has been retracted due to methodological flaws and ethical issues. Numerous studies since then have consistently found no evidence supporting the claim. Major health organizations, including the CDC, WHO, and the Institute of Medicine, affirm that vaccines do not cause autism. Multiple sources refute this claim."
592,1,592,Scientific,Medium,Organic food is more nutritious,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that organic food is more nutritious is a topic of ongoing debate and research. Some studies suggest that organic foods may have higher levels of certain nutrients, such as antioxidants, while others find no significant nutritional differences compared to conventionally grown foods. The variability in findings can be attributed to differences in study design, types of food tested, and agricultural practices. Therefore, the evidence is mixed, making the claim uncertain or unclear."
593,1,593,Scientific,Medium,GMOs are dangerous,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that GMOs are inherently dangerous is likely false. Numerous scientific studies and reviews by reputable organizations, such as the National Academy of Sciences, the World Health Organization, and the American Medical Association, have found that GMOs currently on the market are as safe to eat as their non-GMO counterparts. While there are concerns about environmental impacts and corporate practices, the claim that GMOs are dangerous to human health lacks substantial evidence."
594,1,594,Scientific,Medium,MSG is harmful,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that MSG (monosodium glutamate) is harmful is likely false. Extensive scientific research has shown that MSG is generally recognized as safe by food safety authorities, including the FDA and the European Food Safety Authority. While some individuals may experience mild and temporary symptoms like headaches or flushing after consuming large amounts, these reactions are not common and are not considered harmful. The negative perception of MSG largely stems from anecdotal reports and misconceptions rather than scientific evidence."
595,1,595,Scientific,Medium,Detox diets cleanse toxins,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The human body is naturally equipped with organs like the liver, kidneys, and lungs that effectively detoxify and eliminate waste. Scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of detox diets in enhancing this process is limited. Most claims about detox diets lack rigorous scientific backing, and any perceived benefits are often due to healthier eating habits rather than the diet itself."
596,1,596,Scientific,Medium,Alkaline water is healthier,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that alkaline water is healthier is not strongly supported by scientific evidence. Some proponents suggest it can neutralize acid in the bloodstream, improve metabolism, and help the body absorb nutrients more effectively. However, most health benefits attributed to alkaline water lack rigorous scientific backing. The human body naturally regulates pH balance, and there is limited evidence to suggest that consuming alkaline water provides significant health benefits over regular water. Therefore, the claim remains uncertain and requires more research for a definitive conclusion."
597,1,597,Scientific,Medium,Antioxidants prevent cancer,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that antioxidants prevent cancer is uncertain. While antioxidants can neutralize free radicals and reduce oxidative stress, which is linked to cancer development, scientific evidence does not conclusively prove that antioxidants prevent cancer. Some studies suggest potential benefits, while others show no significant effect or even potential harm in high doses. The relationship between antioxidants and cancer is complex and influenced by various factors, including the type of antioxidant, dosage, and individual health conditions."
598,1,598,Scientific,Medium,Vitamin C prevents colds,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that vitamin C prevents colds is likely false. Numerous studies have shown that vitamin C does not significantly reduce the incidence of colds in the general population. However, it may slightly reduce the duration and severity of cold symptoms. The evidence supporting prevention is weak, leading to a low score for truthfulness."
599,1,599,Scientific,Medium,Antibiotics work on viruses,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Antibiotics are designed to target bacteria, not viruses. They work by attacking the cell walls, protein synthesis, or other functions of bacteria, which viruses do not possess. Therefore, antibiotics are ineffective against viral infections such as the common cold or flu. This is a well-established fact in medical science."
600,1,600,Myths,Medium,You can see the Great Wall from space,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the Great Wall of China can be seen from space is a common myth. While it is theoretically possible to see the Great Wall from low Earth orbit under perfect conditions, it is not easily distinguishable to the naked eye due to its narrow width and the fact that it blends in with the surrounding environment. Astronauts have reported that it is very difficult to see the Great Wall without aid. Therefore, the claim is likely false."
601,1,601,Myths,Medium,Different tongue parts taste different flavors,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that different parts of the tongue are responsible for tasting different flavors is based on a debunked theory known as the ""tongue map."" Scientific research has shown that all taste sensations can be detected across the tongue, although some areas may be slightly more sensitive to certain tastes. The idea of distinct regions for specific tastes is largely a misconception."
602,1,602,Myths,Medium,Goldfish have 3-second memory,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that goldfish have a 3-second memory is a myth. Scientific studies have shown that goldfish can remember information for months. They can be trained to respond to various stimuli and remember tasks, indicating a much longer memory span than 3 seconds."
603,1,603,Myths,Medium,Bulls are enraged by red color,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that bulls are enraged by the color red is likely false. Bulls, like other cattle, are dichromats and cannot see the color red. The perception that bulls are angered by red likely stems from bullfighting, where the movement of the cape, not its color, provokes the bull. The bull reacts to the motion of the cape, which is traditionally red to mask bloodstains, rather than the color itself."
604,1,604,Myths,Medium,Bats are blind,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""bats are blind"" is definitely false. Bats are not blind; they have functional eyes and can see. While many species of bats use echolocation to navigate and hunt in the dark, they also rely on their vision, which can be quite good, especially in low-light conditions. This myth likely stems from their nocturnal nature and reliance on echolocation, but it is not accurate to say they are blind."
605,1,605,Myths,Medium,Ostriches bury heads in sand,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ostriches bury their heads in the sand is a myth. Ostriches do not actually bury their heads in the sand. This misconception likely arises from their behavior of lowering their heads to the ground to turn their eggs or to eat, which can create the illusion from a distance that their heads are buried. This behavior has been well-documented and debunked by experts in animal behavior."
606,1,606,Myths,Medium,Lemmings commit mass suicide,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that lemmings commit mass suicide is a myth. This misconception largely stems from a 1958 Disney documentary, ""White Wilderness,"" which staged scenes of lemmings jumping off cliffs. In reality, lemmings do not intentionally jump to their deaths. Their population dynamics can lead to large migrations, during which some may accidentally fall off cliffs or drown, but this is not a deliberate act of suicide."
607,1,607,Myths,Medium,Chameleons change color to match surroundings,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that chameleons change color to match their surroundings is a common misconception. While chameleons can change color, the primary reasons are for communication, temperature regulation, and mood changes rather than camouflage. Their color changes are influenced by factors such as light, temperature, and social signaling. Therefore, the claim is likely false, but not entirely without basis, as camouflage can occasionally be a secondary effect."
608,1,608,Myths,Medium,Touching baby birds makes parents abandon them,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that touching baby birds causes their parents to abandon them is largely a myth. Most birds have a limited sense of smell and are unlikely to detect human scent on their chicks. Therefore, touching a baby bird does not typically lead to abandonment by the parents. However, it is generally advised to avoid handling wildlife unnecessarily to prevent stress or injury to the animals."
609,1,609,Myths,Medium,Daddy longlegs are most venomous spiders,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that daddy longlegs are the most venomous spiders is a myth. There are two creatures commonly referred to as ""daddy longlegs"": the harvestman (which is not a spider and lacks venom) and the cellar spider (which is a spider but not highly venomous to humans). There is no scientific evidence supporting the idea that either has venom potent enough to be considered the most venomous."
610,1,610,Myths,Medium,Bumblebees shouldn't be able to fly,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that bumblebees shouldn't be able to fly is based on a misunderstanding of aerodynamics. Early calculations using fixed-wing models suggested that bumblebee flight was impossible, but these models were inappropriate for understanding the flight of insects, which use dynamic wing movements. Modern aerodynamic studies show that bumblebees can fly due to their wing flapping patterns, which create lift efficiently. Therefore, the claim is definitely false."
611,1,611,Myths,Medium,Glass is a slow-moving liquid,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that glass is a slow-moving liquid is a misconception. Glass is an amorphous solid, meaning it lacks a long-range ordered crystal structure, but it is not a liquid. The idea likely originated from observations of old glass windows that appear thicker at the bottom, but this is due to historical glassmaking techniques, not the flow of glass over time. Scientific studies have shown that glass does not flow at room temperature."
612,1,612,Historical,Medium,Medieval people thought Earth was flat,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that medieval people thought the Earth was flat is largely a misconception. By the Middle Ages, most educated people in Europe understood that the Earth was spherical. This knowledge was inherited from ancient Greek scholars like Pythagoras and Aristotle, and was further supported by medieval scholars such as Thomas Aquinas. The myth of widespread belief in a flat Earth during the medieval period was popularized in the 19th century."
613,1,613,Historical,Medium,Columbus proved Earth was round,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Columbus proved Earth was round is definitely false. By the time of Columbus's voyages in the late 15th century, the spherical nature of Earth was already well-established among educated Europeans. Ancient Greek scholars like Pythagoras and later Aristotle had proposed a spherical Earth, and Eratosthenes even calculated its circumference in the 3rd century BCE. Columbus's voyages did not prove the Earth was round; rather, they were based on the already accepted understanding of Earth's shape."
614,1,614,Scientific,Medium,Humans evolved from monkeys,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Humans evolved from monkeys"" is misleading. Humans and modern monkeys share a common ancestor, but humans did not directly evolve from monkeys. Both humans and monkeys evolved separately from this common ancestor. The evolutionary tree shows that humans and monkeys are distinct branches that diverged millions of years ago. This misunderstanding often arises from oversimplifying evolutionary theory."
615,1,615,Scientific,Medium,Neanderthals were primitive,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Neanderthals were ""primitive"" is likely false when considering the evidence of their capabilities and behaviors. Neanderthals demonstrated complex behaviors such as tool-making, symbolic thought, and possibly even art and burial practices. They adapted to diverse environments and had a social structure. The term ""primitive"" is often used pejoratively and does not accurately reflect the sophistication of Neanderthal culture and abilities."
616,1,616,Scientific,Medium,Dinosaurs and humans coexisted,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that dinosaurs and humans coexisted is definitely false. Scientific evidence, including fossil records and radiometric dating, shows that non-avian dinosaurs went extinct approximately 66 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period. Humans, specifically Homo sapiens, did not appear until about 300,000 years ago. There is a significant time gap between the extinction of dinosaurs and the emergence of humans, making coexistence impossible."
617,1,617,Scientific,Medium,T-Rex arms were useless,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that T-Rex arms were ""useless"" is likely false. While T-Rex arms were small relative to its body size, research suggests they had strong muscles and could have been used for specific functions such as holding prey, aiding in balance, or mating. The exact purpose is still debated, but the arms were not entirely without function."
618,1,618,Scientific,Medium,All dinosaurs were reptiles,FALSE,TRUE,90.0%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Dinosaurs are traditionally classified as reptiles because they belong to the clade Reptilia, which includes all modern reptiles and their extinct relatives. However, the classification of dinosaurs as reptiles is based on traditional taxonomy, and modern cladistics sometimes categorize them differently due to their evolutionary relationship with birds. Birds are considered avian dinosaurs, which complicates the classification. Despite this, the claim that all dinosaurs were reptiles is largely accepted in a traditional sense, though it is important to note the nuances in modern scientific classification."
619,1,619,Scientific,Medium,Pterodactyls were dinosaurs,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Pterodactyls were not dinosaurs; they were pterosaurs, which are flying reptiles that lived during the time of the dinosaurs. While they coexisted with dinosaurs, they belong to a different group of reptiles. Dinosaurs are a distinct group characterized by specific hip structures and other anatomical features that pterosaurs do not share."
620,1,620,Scientific,Medium,Dinosaurs were cold-blooded,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that dinosaurs were cold-blooded is uncertain. Traditionally, dinosaurs were thought to be cold-blooded like modern reptiles. However, more recent research suggests that many dinosaurs may have been warm-blooded or had a metabolism that was intermediate between cold-blooded and warm-blooded animals. Evidence such as bone structure, growth rates, and isotopic analysis of fossils supports the idea that some dinosaurs could regulate their body temperature more like birds and mammals. The scientific community has not reached a consensus, making the claim unclear."
621,1,621,Scientific,Medium,Asteroid killed all dinosaurs instantly,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that an asteroid killed all dinosaurs instantly is likely false. While a massive asteroid impact around 66 million years ago is widely believed to have caused the mass extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs, the process was not instantaneous. The impact would have caused immediate destruction in the vicinity, but the extinction of dinosaurs was a result of subsequent environmental changes, such as drastic climate shifts and loss of habitat, occurring over a longer period."
622,1,622,Scientific,Medium,Neanderthals couldn't speak,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Neanderthals couldn't speak is likely false. Evidence suggests that Neanderthals had the anatomical structures necessary for speech, such as the hyoid bone, which is similar to that of modern humans. Genetic studies have also shown that Neanderthals possessed the FOXP2 gene, associated with language ability in humans. While it is uncertain if their speech was as complex as modern human language, the evidence indicates they had the capability for some form of spoken communication."
623,1,623,Historical,Medium,Cave people lived in caves,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The term ""cave people"" generally refers to prehistoric humans who are believed to have used caves as shelters. Archaeological evidence supports that some early humans and hominins did indeed use caves for habitation, protection, and as sites for art and burial. However, not all prehistoric humans lived in caves; many lived in other types of shelters. The claim is likely true but not universally applicable to all prehistoric humans."
624,1,624,Historical,Medium,Vikings had horned helmets,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"There is no archaeological evidence to support the claim that Vikings wore horned helmets. This image is largely a product of 19th-century romanticism and popular culture, rather than historical fact. Viking helmets that have been discovered are typically simple and conical, without horns."
625,1,625,Historical,Medium,Medieval armor was too heavy to move,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that medieval armor was too heavy to move is definitely false. Historical evidence and modern experiments show that while medieval armor was indeed heavy, typically weighing between 45 to 55 pounds, it was designed to allow for a reasonable range of movement. Knights and soldiers were able to fight, ride horses, and perform various physical activities while wearing it. The design of the armor distributed the weight across the body, allowing for mobility."
626,1,626,Historical,Medium,Knights rescued damsels in distress,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The idea of knights rescuing damsels in distress is largely a romanticized notion popularized by medieval literature and later adaptations, such as chivalric romances and fairy tales. While knights did exist and were bound by codes of chivalry, historical evidence of them frequently rescuing women in distress is sparse and often fictionalized. The claim is more rooted in myth and storytelling than in historical fact."
627,1,627,Historical,Medium,Witches were burned in Salem,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that witches were burned in Salem is definitely false. During the Salem witch trials of 1692, none of the accused witches were burned at the stake. Instead, 19 individuals were hanged, and one person was pressed to death with heavy stones. Burning was not a method of execution used in the Salem witch trials."
628,1,628,Historical,Medium,Iron maiden was medieval torture device,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The iron maiden is often thought of as a medieval torture device, but historical evidence suggests it was not used during the medieval period. Most examples of iron maidens were created in the 18th and 19th centuries, likely as part of sensationalized exhibitions. There is little to no credible evidence that iron maidens were used as torture devices in the Middle Ages."
629,1,629,Historical,Medium,Chastity belts were used in Crusades,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that chastity belts were used during the Crusades is likely false. Historical evidence suggests that the concept of chastity belts as a medieval practice is largely a myth. Most artifacts identified as chastity belts have been dated to the 18th and 19th centuries, often as curiosities or jokes rather than functional devices. There is little to no credible evidence supporting their use during the time of the Crusades, which occurred from the 11th to the 13th centuries."
630,1,630,Historical,Medium,Napoleon was very short,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Napoleon was very short is likely false. Historical records indicate that Napoleon Bonaparte was around 5 feet 6 inches tall, which was average height for a Frenchman of his time. The misconception about his height may have arisen from differences in French and English measurement systems or from British propaganda."
631,1,631,Historical,Medium,George Washington had wooden teeth,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that George Washington had wooden teeth is a common myth. Historical evidence shows that Washington's dentures were made from materials such as human teeth, animal teeth, ivory, and metal alloys, but not wood. The misconception may have arisen from the appearance of the dentures, which could have been stained and looked wooden."
632,1,632,Historical,Medium,Benjamin Franklin discovered electricity,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Benjamin Franklin did not discover electricity; rather, he conducted experiments that contributed to the understanding of electricity. Electricity was known to exist before Franklin's time, with earlier experiments conducted by scientists like William Gilbert and Stephen Gray. Franklin's famous kite experiment demonstrated the electrical nature of lightning, which was a significant contribution to the study of electricity, but it was not a discovery of electricity itself."
633,1,633,Historical,Medium,Einstein failed math,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Einstein failed math is a myth. Albert Einstein himself refuted this claim, stating that he had mastered differential and integral calculus before he was 15. Historical records and his academic performance indicate that he was proficient in mathematics from a young age."
634,1,634,Historical,Medium,Nero fiddled while Rome burned,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""Nero fiddled while Rome burned"" is likely false. Historical accounts suggest that Nero was not in Rome when the fire started in 64 AD and returned to the city to organize relief efforts. Additionally, the fiddle did not exist at the time; Nero was known to play the lyre. The phrase is often used metaphorically to suggest negligence, but it is not supported by historical evidence."
635,1,635,Historical,Medium,Marie Antoinette said 'Let them eat cake',FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Marie Antoinette said ""Let them eat cake"" is likely false. There is no historical evidence that she ever uttered this phrase. The quote is often attributed to her, but it appears to have originated from Jean-Jacques Rousseau's ""Confessions,"" written when Marie Antoinette was a child. Historians generally agree that the phrase was used to illustrate the disconnect between the French monarchy and the common people, rather than being a direct quote from Marie Antoinette herself."
636,1,636,Historical,Medium,Mussolini made trains run on time,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Mussolini made trains run on time is largely a myth. While Mussolini's regime did focus on improving infrastructure, including the railways, many of the improvements attributed to him were already underway before he came to power. Additionally, propaganda played a significant role in promoting this narrative to bolster the image of efficiency under fascism. Historical evidence suggests that while there were some improvements, the extent to which Mussolini personally influenced the punctuality of trains is exaggerated."
637,1,637,Historical,Medium,The pyramids were built by slaves,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the pyramids were built by slaves is likely false. Archaeological evidence suggests that the workers who built the pyramids were not slaves but rather paid laborers. Excavations have uncovered workers' villages with evidence of organized labor, including housing, food supplies, and medical care, indicating that these workers were skilled laborers who were compensated for their work. This challenges the long-held belief that slaves built the pyramids, which was popularized by historical narratives but lacks substantial evidence."
638,1,638,Historical,Medium,Cleopatra was Egyptian ethnically,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Cleopatra VII, the last active ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, was of Macedonian Greek descent. The Ptolemaic dynasty was established by Ptolemy I Soter, a companion of Alexander the Great, and they ruled Egypt after Alexander's conquest. While Cleopatra was born in Egypt and was culturally Egyptian, her ethnic background was primarily Greek. There is no substantial evidence to suggest she had significant Egyptian ancestry."
639,1,639,Historical,Medium,Julius Caesar was born by C-section,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Julius Caesar was born by C-section is likely false. Historical evidence suggests that C-sections in ancient times were typically performed only when the mother was dead or dying, as the procedure was almost always fatal for the mother. Caesar's mother, Aurelia, is known to have survived his birth, making it unlikely that he was delivered by C-section. The association of Caesar's name with the procedure is more likely a later myth or misunderstanding."
640,1,640,Historical,Medium,Paul Revere shouted 'The British are coming',FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Historical evidence suggests that Paul Revere did not shout ""The British are coming"" during his famous midnight ride. Instead, he likely used more discreet warnings, as the countryside was filled with British troops and many colonists still considered themselves British. The phrase is a later embellishment popularized by folklore and literature."
641,1,641,Historical,Medium,Cowboys wore cowboy hats,FALSE,TRUE,90.0%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that cowboys wore cowboy hats is generally true. Historical evidence and cultural depictions consistently show cowboys wearing wide-brimmed hats, often referred to as cowboy hats, which were practical for protection against the sun and rain. While not every cowboy may have worn this specific style at all times, it is a well-documented and iconic part of cowboy attire."
642,1,642,Historical,Medium,Wild West had frequent shootouts,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The popular image of the Wild West as a place of frequent shootouts is largely a myth perpetuated by movies and literature. Historical records indicate that while there were some famous gunfights, such as the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, they were not as common as often portrayed. Many towns had strict gun control laws, and most disputes were settled without violence. Therefore, the claim that the Wild West had frequent shootouts is likely false."
643,1,643,Historical,Medium,Pirates made people walk the plank,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The idea of pirates making people walk the plank is a popular trope in fiction, but historical evidence supporting this practice is sparse. While there are a few documented instances, they are rare and not representative of common pirate behavior. Most historical accounts suggest that pirates used more direct and brutal methods of dealing with captives."
644,1,644,Historical,Medium,Pirates buried treasure,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The popular image of pirates burying treasure is largely a myth popularized by literature, such as ""Treasure Island"" by Robert Louis Stevenson. Historical evidence suggests that pirates typically spent or traded their loot rather than burying it. While there may be isolated instances of pirates hiding valuables, it was not a common practice."
645,1,645,Historical,Medium,Vikings discovered America first,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Vikings discovered America first is likely true, as there is substantial evidence that Norse explorer Leif Erikson reached North America around the year 1000, specifically an area known as Vinland, which is believed to be part of modern-day Newfoundland, Canada. This predates Christopher Columbus's voyage by nearly 500 years. Archaeological findings, such as the Norse settlement at L'Anse aux Meadows, support this claim. However, it is important to note that indigenous peoples had been living in the Americas long before the Vikings arrived."
646,1,646,Historical,Medium,Leif Erikson reached North America,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Historical evidence and Norse sagas, such as the Saga of the Greenlanders and the Saga of Erik the Red, suggest that Leif Erikson, a Norse explorer, reached North America around the year 1000 AD. Archaeological findings at L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland, Canada, support the presence of Norse settlers in North America, aligning with the timeline of Erikson's voyage. While some details of the sagas are debated, the consensus among historians is that Leif Erikson did reach North America."
647,1,647,Historical,Medium,"The Pinta, Nina, and Santa Maria were large ships",FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The Pinta, Nina, and Santa Maria were not considered large ships by the standards of their time. The Santa Maria was the largest of the three, but even it was relatively small compared to other ships of the era, such as galleons. The Pinta and Nina were caravels, which were smaller and more maneuverable. Therefore, the claim that they were large ships is likely false."
648,1,648,Historical,Medium,Pocahontas saved John Smith,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The story of Pocahontas saving John Smith is primarily based on Smith's own accounts, which he wrote years after the alleged event. Historians debate the accuracy of his narrative, as it may have been exaggerated or misinterpreted. There is no corroborating evidence from other sources, and some suggest it could have been a ritual misunderstood by Smith. Thus, the claim remains uncertain."
649,1,649,Historical,Medium,Pocahontas married John Smith,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Pocahontas married John Smith is definitely false. Historical records clearly indicate that Pocahontas married John Rolfe, an English tobacco planter, in 1614. John Smith was an English explorer and soldier who had interactions with Pocahontas, but they were never married."
650,1,650,Historical,Medium,Thanksgiving was always in November,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Thanksgiving has not always been in November. The first Thanksgiving in 1621 did not have a fixed date and was celebrated in late autumn. It wasn't until 1863 that President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed a national Thanksgiving Day to be held in November. Before that, Thanksgiving dates varied by state and were not consistently in November."
651,1,651,Historical,Medium,Pilgrims wore black and white,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The common image of Pilgrims wearing black and white clothing is largely a myth. Historical evidence suggests that Pilgrims wore a variety of colors, including reds, greens, browns, and blues. Black and white clothing was typically reserved for formal occasions and was not the everyday attire of Pilgrims. This misconception likely stems from later artistic depictions and cultural narratives rather than historical reality."
652,1,652,Historical,Medium,Pilgrims and Native Americans were friends,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The relationship between the Pilgrims and Native Americans was complex and varied over time. Initially, there were instances of cooperation and mutual assistance, such as the Pilgrims receiving help from the Wampanoag tribe, which included the famous 1621 harvest celebration often referred to as the ""First Thanksgiving."" However, this relationship was not uniformly friendly and deteriorated over time, leading to conflicts such as King Philip's War. The claim oversimplifies a nuanced historical relationship, making it neither entirely true nor false."
653,1,653,Historical,Medium,Native Americans didn't use the wheel,FALSE,TRUE,90.0%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Native Americans didn't use the wheel is likely true in the context of pre-Columbian North and South America, where the wheel was not used for transportation or practical purposes. However, some Mesoamerican cultures, such as the Maya, did create wheeled toys, indicating an understanding of the wheel concept. The absence of large domesticated animals for pulling carts and the terrain may have contributed to the limited practical use of the wheel."
654,1,654,Historical,Medium,Columbus discovered tobacco,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Tobacco was already being used by indigenous peoples in the Americas long before Columbus arrived. While Columbus and his crew were among the first Europeans to encounter tobacco, they did not ""discover"" it in the sense of being the first to find or use it. The claim is likely false because it overlooks the pre-existing use of tobacco by native populations."
655,1,655,Historical,Medium,Tomatoes were thought poisonous in Europe,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that tomatoes were thought to be poisonous in Europe is likely true. When tomatoes were introduced to Europe from the Americas in the 16th century, they were initially met with suspicion. This was partly because tomatoes are part of the nightshade family, which includes some toxic plants. Additionally, the acidity of tomatoes could cause them to leach lead from pewter plates, leading to lead poisoning, which may have contributed to their reputation. Over time, as culinary practices evolved and understanding improved, tomatoes became a staple in European cuisine."
656,1,656,Historical,Medium,Potatoes caused Irish famine,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""potatoes caused the Irish famine"" is misleading. The Irish Potato Famine, which occurred from 1845 to 1852, was primarily caused by a potato disease known as late blight, which devastated the potato crops that were a staple food for the Irish population. However, the famine was exacerbated by political and economic factors, including British government policies and land ownership issues, which hindered effective relief efforts. Therefore, while the failure of the potato crop was a trigger, it was not the sole cause of the famine."
657,1,657,Historical,Medium,Tea caused Boston Tea Party,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The Boston Tea Party was a political protest by American colonists against British taxation policies, specifically the Tea Act of 1773. While tea itself was not the direct cause, it was the commodity taxed under the Tea Act, which led to the protest. Therefore, tea was a central element in the events leading to the Boston Tea Party, but it was the taxation and political implications that were the true causes."
658,1,658,Historical,Medium,Shot heard round the world was literal,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The phrase ""shot heard round the world"" is a metaphorical expression, not a literal one. It refers to the first shot of the American Revolutionary War at the Battles of Lexington and Concord in 1775, symbolizing the start of a significant global event. It was not literally heard around the world."
659,1,659,Historical,Medium,Declaration signed on July 4th,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4th is likely false. While the Continental Congress adopted the Declaration on July 4, 1776, most delegates did not sign it until August 2, 1776. Historical evidence indicates that only a few signatures, if any, were added on July 4th itself."
660,1,660,Historical,Medium,Liberty Bell cracked on July 4th,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The Liberty Bell did not crack on July 4th. The bell is believed to have first cracked in the early 19th century, possibly during a test ringing or a public event, but not specifically on July 4th. The most famous crack occurred in 1846 during a ringing for George Washington's birthday. There is no historical evidence to support the claim that it cracked on July 4th."
661,1,661,Historical,Medium,Betsy Ross designed the flag,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Betsy Ross designed the first American flag is largely based on family lore and lacks substantial historical evidence. The story was popularized by her descendants nearly a century after the flag's creation. Historians have found no definitive documentation from the Revolutionary period to confirm her role in designing the flag. While she was a known seamstress in Philadelphia and may have sewn flags, the design attribution remains speculative."
662,1,662,Historical,Medium,Star Spangled Banner written during War of 1812,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The ""Star-Spangled Banner"" was indeed written during the War of 1812. Francis Scott Key composed the poem, which later became the lyrics to the national anthem of the United States, after witnessing the bombardment of Fort McHenry by British forces in September 1814. This event occurred during the War of 1812, confirming the claim as true."
663,1,663,Historical,Medium,White House was always white,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The White House was not always white. Originally, the building was constructed with grayish sandstone. It was first painted white in 1798 to protect the porous stone from freezing and cracking during winter. Therefore, the claim that the White House was always white is likely false."
664,1,664,Historical,Medium,Lincoln wrote Gettysburg Address on envelope,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Lincoln wrote the Gettysburg Address on an envelope is a popular myth. Historical evidence suggests that Lincoln prepared multiple drafts of the speech, and the most reliable accounts indicate he wrote it on standard paper, not an envelope. The myth likely arose from the idea that he wrote it hastily, but this is not supported by historical documentation."
665,1,665,Historical,Medium,Lincoln freed all slaves with Emancipation,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The Emancipation Proclamation, issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863, declared the freedom of slaves in the Confederate states that were in rebellion against the Union. However, it did not apply to slave-holding border states that remained loyal to the Union or areas of the Confederacy that had already come under Union control. Therefore, it did not free all slaves in the United States. The complete abolition of slavery was achieved with the ratification of the 13th Amendment in December 1865."
666,1,666,Historical,Medium,Civil War was only about slavery,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The American Civil War was primarily about slavery, as evidenced by declarations from seceding states and speeches by Confederate leaders. However, it also involved other factors such as states' rights, economic differences, and political power struggles. While slavery was the central issue, it was not the sole factor, making the claim likely false."
667,1,667,Historical,Medium,Grant was a drunk,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Ulysses S. Grant, the 18th President of the United States and a prominent Union general during the Civil War, was known to have issues with alcohol. Historical accounts and testimonies from contemporaries suggest that Grant did struggle with drinking, particularly during periods of inactivity. However, the extent of his drinking and its impact on his duties is debated among historians. While some reports may have been exaggerated, there is enough evidence to suggest that Grant had a problematic relationship with alcohol, making the claim likely true."
668,1,668,Historical,Medium,Lee owned slaves reluctantly,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Historical evidence suggests that Robert E. Lee inherited slaves from his father-in-law's estate and managed them as part of his duties as executor. While some accounts suggest he found slavery distasteful, he actively managed and enforced the institution, including punishing escaped slaves. His actions indicate a level of acceptance and participation inconsistent with reluctance."
669,1,669,Historical,Medium,Reconstruction succeeded,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The success of Reconstruction is a complex and debated topic. Reconstruction, the period following the American Civil War, aimed to reintegrate Southern states into the Union and address the status of former slaves. It achieved some successes, such as the passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments, which abolished slavery and granted citizenship and voting rights to African Americans. However, it also faced significant failures, including the rise of Jim Crow laws, the establishment of discriminatory practices, and the eventual withdrawal of federal troops, which led to the disenfranchisement and marginalization of African Americans. The mixed outcomes make it difficult to definitively categorize Reconstruction as a success or failure."
670,1,670,Historical,Medium,Jim Crow laws were unofficial,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Jim Crow laws were official state and local laws enacted in the United States, primarily in the Southern states, from the late 19th century until the mid-20th century. These laws mandated racial segregation and disenfranchised African Americans. They were legally sanctioned and enforced by government authorities, making the claim that they were ""unofficial"" definitely false."

It follows a valid syllogistic structure: If all cats are mammals (premise 1), and all mammals breathe (premise 2), then it logically follows that all cats breathe (conclusion). Both premises are true, making the conclusion definitely true."
672,1,672,Logic_Reasoning,Hard,"Some doctors are rich, some rich are unhappy, so some doctors are unhappy",FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim uses logical reasoning based on generalizations, but it does not provide direct evidence or a logical necessity for the conclusion. While it is possible that some doctors are unhappy, the premises do not logically guarantee this conclusion. The statement ""some doctors are rich"" and ""some rich are unhappy"" does not necessarily imply that ""some doctors are unhappy,"" as the sets may not overlap. Therefore, the claim is uncertain without additional information."
673,1,673,Logic_Reasoning,Hard,You're either with us or against us,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""You're either with us or against us"" presents a false dichotomy, suggesting only two possible positions in a situation where more nuanced stances may exist. In reality, individuals or groups can have neutral, mixed, or independent positions that do not align strictly with being ""for"" or ""against"" a particular side. This oversimplification does not account for the complexity of most issues, making the claim likely false."
674,1,674,Logic_Reasoning,Hard,My father has two sons and I have two brothers,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim contains a logical inconsistency. If the speaker's father has two sons, and the speaker is one of them, then the speaker can only have one brother, not two. Therefore, the statement is likely false."
675,1,675,Logic_Reasoning,Hard,"My sister has three brothers, I have two brothers",FALSE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim suggests that the speaker and their sister share the same family, implying that the speaker is one of the brothers. If the speaker is one of the brothers, then the sister having three brothers would include the speaker, making the statement consistent. However, without additional context or information about the family structure, there is a small possibility of alternative interpretations, such as half-siblings or step-siblings, which slightly reduces the confidence level."

681,1,681,Logic_Reasoning,Hard,More firefighters at fires cause more damage,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that more firefighters at fires cause more damage is likely false. The presence of more firefighters is typically a response to larger or more severe fires, which inherently cause more damage. The correlation between the number of firefighters and the extent of damage is not causal; rather, both are effects of the fire's severity. Therefore, the claim misunderstands the relationship between these variables."

This reasoning does not account for changes in context, new evidence, or improvements that could make alternative methods more effective or appropriate. Therefore, the claim is likely false, as tradition alone does not determine the correctness of an action or method."

It excels at addressing empirical questions that can be tested and observed. However, it struggles with questions that are metaphysical, ethical, or subjective in nature, such as those concerning meaning, morality, or aesthetics. These areas often require philosophical, ethical, or theological approaches. Therefore, while science can answer many questions, it cannot answer all."
759,1,759,Controversial,Hard,Is progress inevitable?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Is progress inevitable?"" is inherently ambiguous and subjective, as it depends on how one defines ""progress"" and the context in which it is considered. Historically, human societies have experienced periods of both advancement and regression. While technological and scientific advancements often suggest a trend towards progress, social, economic, and environmental factors can lead to setbacks. Therefore, the inevitability of progress is uncertain and context-dependent, making it difficult to definitively categorize as true or false."
760,1,760,Controversial,Hard,Do abstract objects exist?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The existence of abstract objects is a philosophical question rather than an empirical one. Abstract objects, such as numbers, properties, and concepts, are not physical entities and their existence is debated among philosophers. Some argue they exist as non-physical entities (Platonism), while others claim they are merely useful fictions or linguistic constructs (Nominalism). The lack of empirical evidence and the philosophical nature of the question make it unclear whether abstract objects ""exist"" in the same way physical objects do."
761,1,761,Controversial,Hard,Can we know anything for certain?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Can we know anything for certain?"" is a philosophical question that has been debated for centuries. In epistemology, some argue that certain knowledge is possible (e.g., mathematical truths), while others, like skeptics, argue that certainty is unattainable. The nature of certainty is subjective and context-dependent, making the claim inherently uncertain."
762,1,762,Controversial,Hard,Is solipsism refutable?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Solipsism, the philosophical idea that only one's mind is sure to exist, is inherently difficult to refute because it is based on subjective experience. There is no empirical evidence that can definitively prove or disprove the existence of anything outside one's own mind. Philosophers have debated this topic extensively, but no consensus has been reached. Therefore, the claim that solipsism is refutable remains uncertain."
763,1,763,Controversial,Hard,Does the universe have a purpose?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Does the universe have a purpose?"" is a philosophical and metaphysical question rather than a scientific one. There is no empirical evidence or scientific consensus that can definitively answer this question. Different philosophical, religious, and scientific perspectives offer varying interpretations, but none can be proven or disproven with certainty. Therefore, the claim remains uncertain and subjective, leading to a score of 0.5. My confidence in this assessment is moderate, as it is based on the nature of the question rather than empirical data."
764,1,764,Controversial,Hard,Is enlightenment achievable?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The concept of enlightenment is subjective and varies across different philosophical, spiritual, and religious traditions. In Buddhism, for example, enlightenment (nirvana) is considered achievable through specific practices and teachings. However, in other contexts, it may be seen as an abstract or metaphorical state. The lack of a universally accepted definition or empirical evidence makes it difficult to definitively assess the claim's truthfulness."
765,1,765,Controversial,Hard,Can evil be justified?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Can evil be justified?"" is inherently subjective and depends on moral, cultural, and philosophical perspectives. What one person or society considers ""evil"" might be seen as justified or necessary by another, often based on context, intentions, or outcomes. Historical and ethical debates, such as those surrounding war, punishment, or self-defense, illustrate the complexity of justifying actions deemed evil. Therefore, the truthfulness of the claim is uncertain and varies widely, making it difficult to definitively categorize."
766,1,766,Controversial,Hard,Is revenge ever justified?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The justification of revenge is subjective and varies based on cultural, ethical, and individual perspectives. Some may argue that revenge can be justified as a form of justice or deterrence, while others see it as morally wrong or counterproductive. The lack of a universally accepted standard makes the claim uncertain."
767,1,767,Controversial,Hard,Should we value equality or freedom more?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim is a subjective question rather than a factual statement, making it inherently uncertain. The value placed on equality versus freedom depends on individual beliefs, cultural contexts, and philosophical perspectives. Therefore, it cannot be objectively rated as true or false."

Virtue is a moral standard that varies across societies, and while some view patriotism as a positive moral quality, others may see it as potentially leading to nationalism or exclusion. Therefore, the truthfulness of the claim is uncertain and cannot be definitively rated as true or false."
769,1,769,Controversial,Hard,Should art have moral limits?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Should art have moral limits?"" is a subjective question rather than a factual statement, making it inherently uncertain. The answer depends on individual perspectives, cultural norms, and philosophical beliefs about the role of art in society. Some argue that art should challenge moral boundaries to provoke thought and discussion, while others believe it should adhere to certain ethical standards to avoid harm. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively rated as true or false."
770,1,770,Controversial,Hard,Is cultural relativism true?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Cultural relativism is a philosophical concept suggesting that a person's beliefs and activities should be understood based on that person's own culture, rather than be judged against the criteria of another culture. The truthfulness of cultural relativism is subjective and depends on one's philosophical perspective. It is not an empirical claim that can be definitively proven or disproven, making it inherently uncertain. The concept is widely debated in anthropology and ethics, with arguments both for and against its validity. Therefore, the claim is best rated as uncertain."
771,1,771,Controversial,Hard,Can we have knowledge without experience?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Can we have knowledge without experience?"" is a philosophical question that has been debated extensively. Some philosophical perspectives, like rationalism, argue that certain knowledge can be innate or derived through reason without direct experience. Conversely, empiricism posits that knowledge comes primarily from sensory experience. The truthfulness of the claim depends on the philosophical framework one subscribes to, making it inherently uncertain and subjective."
772,1,772,Controversial,Hard,Is determinism compatible with free will?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The compatibility of determinism with free will is a longstanding philosophical debate with no definitive resolution. Compatibilists argue that free will can coexist with determinism, suggesting that free will is the ability to act according to one's motivations, even if those motivations are determined. In contrast, incompatibilists believe that if determinism is true, free will cannot exist because our actions would be predetermined. The claim's truthfulness depends on one's philosophical perspective, making it inherently uncertain."
773,1,773,Controversial,Hard,Should we preserve all languages?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Should we preserve all languages?"" is subjective and depends on various factors, including cultural, historical, and practical considerations. While preserving languages can maintain cultural heritage and diversity, it may not always be feasible or prioritized due to resource constraints and the natural evolution of languages. The claim is neither definitively true nor false, as it involves value judgments and differing perspectives on language preservation."
774,1,774,Controversial,Hard,Is tradition valuable in itself?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The value of tradition is subjective and context-dependent. Traditions can provide cultural continuity, identity, and social cohesion, which some may find inherently valuable. However, others may view traditions as outdated or restrictive. The claim's truthfulness varies based on individual perspectives and societal contexts, making it uncertain overall."
775,1,775,Controversial,Hard,Can machines be creative?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Machines, particularly those using artificial intelligence, have demonstrated the ability to produce outputs that can be considered creative, such as generating art, music, and literature. These outputs often mimic human creativity by combining existing ideas in novel ways. However, the debate continues on whether this constitutes true creativity or is merely an advanced form of pattern recognition and synthesis. Given the evidence of machines producing creative works, the claim is likely true, but the philosophical aspect of what constitutes ""creativity"" leaves some room for interpretation."
776,1,776,Controversial,Hard,Is social progress real?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Social progress can be observed through historical improvements in areas such as human rights, education, healthcare, and technology. Indicators like increased life expectancy, reduced poverty rates, and expanded civil rights suggest that social progress is real. However, progress is not uniform across all regions or groups, and setbacks can occur. The concept of social progress is complex and multifaceted, but evidence supports its general reality."

It does not have a truth value in the traditional sense, as it depends on subjective perspectives, ethical considerations, and potential scientific outcomes. The question's answer varies based on individual beliefs, cultural norms, and scientific advancements, making it inherently uncertain and subjective."
778,1,778,Controversial,Hard,Is inequality always bad?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""inequality is always bad"" is likely false because inequality can have both negative and positive aspects depending on the context. While economic and social inequalities can lead to negative outcomes such as reduced social mobility and increased poverty, some level of inequality can incentivize innovation and economic growth. Additionally, not all forms of inequality are inherently harmful; for example, differences in skills and talents can lead to beneficial diversity in society. Therefore, the impact of inequality is complex and context-dependent."
779,1,779,Controversial,Hard,Can war ever be just?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Can war ever be just?"" is inherently subjective and philosophical, making it unclear and dependent on individual perspectives and ethical frameworks. The concept of a ""just war"" is debated in moral philosophy and international law, with criteria like just cause, proportionality, and last resort being used to evaluate the justice of a war. However, differing interpretations and values lead to varying conclusions, making the claim uncertain."
780,1,780,Controversial,Hard,Is censorship ever justified?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Is censorship ever justified?"" is subjective and context-dependent. Censorship can be justified in certain situations, such as to protect national security, prevent hate speech, or protect minors from harmful content. However, it can also be misused to suppress dissent and limit freedom of expression. The justification for censorship depends on the specific circumstances and the balance between protecting societal interests and preserving individual freedoms."
781,1,781,Controversial,Hard,Should we extend human lifespan?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Should we extend human lifespan?"" is a question rather than a factual statement, making it inherently uncertain and subjective. The question involves ethical, social, and scientific considerations, and opinions vary widely. Some argue for lifespan extension due to potential benefits like increased knowledge and experience, while others raise concerns about overpopulation and resource allocation. The assessment of this claim depends on individual values and societal priorities, making it unclear whether it is definitively true or false."
782,1,782,Scientific,Medium,DNA is shaped like a double helix,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that DNA is shaped like a double helix is well-established and widely accepted in the scientific community. The double helix structure of DNA was first described by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, and it has been confirmed by numerous studies and observations since then. This structure is fundamental to understanding how DNA functions in biological systems."
783,1,783,Scientific,Medium,Cells are the basic unit of life,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""cells are the basic unit of life"" is a fundamental principle of biology known as the cell theory. This theory states that all living organisms are composed of cells, and that the cell is the smallest unit of life that can function independently. This concept is widely accepted and supported by extensive scientific evidence."
784,1,784,Scientific,Medium,Mitochondria produce energy,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Mitochondria are known as the ""powerhouses"" of the cell because they are responsible for producing energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through a process called oxidative phosphorylation. This is a well-established scientific fact supported by extensive research in cell biology."
785,1,785,Scientific,Medium,Chloroplasts perform photosynthesis,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Chloroplasts are organelles found in the cells of plants and some algae. They are the sites where photosynthesis occurs, a process that converts light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose. This is a well-established scientific fact."
786,1,786,Scientific,Medium,Bacteria are single-celled organisms,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Bacteria are indeed single-celled organisms. They are classified as prokaryotes, which are unicellular organisms that lack a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. This is a well-established fact in microbiology."
787,1,787,Scientific,Medium,Viruses are living organisms,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Viruses are not considered living organisms by most scientists because they lack key characteristics of life, such as the ability to reproduce independently and carry out metabolic processes. They require a host cell to replicate, which distinguishes them from living organisms. However, some debate exists due to their ability to evolve and interact with living cells, but the prevailing scientific consensus is that they are not living."
788,1,788,Scientific,Medium,Antibiotics kill viruses,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Antibiotics are designed to target bacteria, not viruses. They work by attacking the cell walls, protein synthesis, or DNA replication of bacteria, none of which are applicable to viruses. Viruses have a different structure and replication process, which antibiotics cannot affect. Therefore, the claim that antibiotics kill viruses is definitely false."
789,1,789,Scientific,Medium,Vaccines contain dead viruses,FALSE,TRUE,90.0%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Some vaccines do contain dead (inactivated) viruses, such as the inactivated polio vaccine and the hepatitis A vaccine. However, not all vaccines use dead viruses; some use live attenuated viruses, viral vectors, or mRNA technology. Therefore, the claim is likely true for certain vaccines but not universally applicable to all vaccines."
790,1,790,Scientific,Medium,Blood type O is universal donor,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that blood type O is a universal donor is generally true but requires clarification. Specifically, blood type O negative (O-) is considered the universal donor for red blood cells because it lacks A, B, and Rh antigens, minimizing the risk of an immune reaction in recipients of any blood type. However, O positive (O+) blood is not universally compatible with all recipients, as it contains the Rh antigen. Therefore, the claim is likely true when referring to O negative blood, but not universally true for all O blood types."
791,1,791,Scientific,Medium,Humans have 206 bones as adults,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that humans have 206 bones as adults is accurate. This is a well-established fact in human anatomy. While infants are born with approximately 270 bones, some of these bones fuse together during growth, resulting in the standard count of 206 bones in a typical adult human skeleton."
792,1,792,Scientific,Medium,The heart has four chambers,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the heart has four chambers is definitely true. In humans and other mammals, the heart is anatomically divided into four chambers: two atria (the left atrium and the right atrium) and two ventricles (the left ventricle and the right ventricle). This structure is well-documented in medical and biological sciences."
793,1,793,Scientific,Medium,The brain uses most of body's energy,FALSE,TRUE,90.0%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The brain, while accounting for only about 2% of body weight, uses approximately 20% of the body's energy, primarily in the form of glucose. This is a significant portion, but it is not the majority of the body's energy. Other organs and systems, such as muscles during physical activity, also consume substantial amounts of energy. Therefore, the claim is likely true in the sense that the brain is a major energy consumer, but it does not use most of the body's energy."
794,1,794,Scientific,Medium,Neurons can regenerate easily,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) of mammals, including humans, generally do not regenerate easily. While some neurogenesis (the process of generating new neurons) occurs in specific brain regions like the hippocampus, it is limited and not indicative of widespread or easy regeneration. In contrast, neurons in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) have a greater capacity for regeneration, but this is still not considered ""easy"" compared to other cell types. Overall, the claim is misleading as it oversimplifies the complex and limited nature of neuronal regeneration."
795,1,795,Scientific,Medium,The liver can regenerate,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the liver can regenerate is definitely true. The liver is unique among human organs for its remarkable ability to regenerate after injury or partial surgical removal. Scientific studies and medical literature consistently support this capability, noting that the liver can regrow to its original size even if up to 70% of it is removed, as long as the remaining tissue is healthy."
796,1,796,Scientific,Medium,Kidneys filter blood,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""kidneys filter blood"" is definitely true. The primary function of the kidneys is to filter waste products and excess substances from the blood, which are then excreted as urine. This process is essential for maintaining the body's internal environment, including electrolyte balance and blood pressure regulation. This is a well-established fact in human physiology."
797,1,797,Scientific,Medium,The appendix is completely useless,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the appendix is completely useless is likely false. While historically considered a vestigial organ with no function, recent research suggests that the appendix may play a role in gut health by serving as a reservoir for beneficial bacteria. This function can be important in repopulating the gut flora after infections. However, the appendix is not essential for survival, as people can live without it, which may contribute to the misconception of its uselessness."
798,1,798,Scientific,Medium,Tonsils serve no purpose,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Tonsils are part of the lymphatic system and play a role in the immune response by trapping pathogens that enter through the mouth or nose. They help produce antibodies and white blood cells to fight infections. While they can be removed if problematic, they do have a purpose, particularly in early childhood when the immune system is still developing."
799,1,799,Scientific,Medium,Wisdom teeth are vestigial,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Wisdom teeth are considered vestigial because they were useful to our ancestors who had larger jaws and a diet that required more chewing power. As human diets and jaw sizes have evolved, wisdom teeth have become less necessary and often cause dental issues, leading to their classification as vestigial. However, they still serve a function in some individuals, which is why the claim is rated as likely true rather than definitely true."
800,1,800,Scientific,Medium,Fingerprints are unique,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Fingerprints are generally considered unique to each individual, and this has been a foundational principle in forensic science for over a century. The uniqueness is based on the complex patterns of ridges and minutiae points. However, there is a small possibility of similar fingerprints, especially in identical twins, though even they have distinct fingerprints. The claim is likely true, but the absolute uniqueness of fingerprints has been debated, leading to a slightly lower confidence level."
801,1,801,Scientific,Medium,Identical twins have same DNA,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Identical twins originate from the same fertilized egg, which means they start with the same DNA. However, mutations can occur during cell division, leading to slight genetic differences. Additionally, epigenetic changes can cause variations in gene expression. While they have very similar DNA, they are not 100% identical at the genetic level."
802,1,802,Scientific,Medium,Blood is red because of iron,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Blood is red primarily because of the presence of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that contains iron. The iron in hemoglobin binds with oxygen, and this oxygenated form of hemoglobin is what gives blood its bright red color. While iron is a crucial component, it is the interaction of iron within hemoglobin and oxygen that results in the red color. Therefore, the claim is likely true, but it simplifies the explanation by not mentioning hemoglobin and its role."
803,1,803,Scientific,Medium,Veins carry blue blood,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that veins carry blue blood is definitely false. Human blood is always red due to the presence of hemoglobin, which is red when oxygenated and darker red when deoxygenated. Veins appear blue through the skin due to the way light penetrates the skin and is absorbed and scattered by the tissues and blood. This optical effect does not indicate that the blood itself is blue."
804,1,804,Scientific,Medium,The tongue map is accurate,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The tongue map, which suggests that different parts of the tongue are responsible for tasting different flavors (sweet, salty, sour, bitter), is largely inaccurate. Scientific research has shown that all taste sensations can be detected by all areas of the tongue, although some areas may be slightly more sensitive to certain tastes. The concept of the tongue map originated from a misinterpretation of a German study in the early 20th century and has since been debunked by modern taste research."
805,1,805,Scientific,Medium,Humans have only five senses,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that humans have only five senses is likely false. While the traditional view is that humans have five senses (sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch), scientific understanding recognizes additional senses such as balance (vestibular sense), temperature (thermoception), pain (nociception), and body position (proprioception), among others. Therefore, the number of human senses is generally considered to be more than five."
806,1,806,Scientific,Medium,The skin is the largest organ,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The skin is widely recognized in the scientific and medical communities as the largest organ of the human body. It covers the entire body, accounting for about 16% of a person's total body weight, and serves multiple critical functions, including protection, regulation, and sensation. This claim is well-supported by anatomical and physiological evidence."
807,1,807,Scientific,Medium,Hair and nails are alive,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Hair and nails are composed of keratin, a protein, and are not alive. The cells that produce hair and nails are alive, but the hair and nails themselves are not. Once they are formed, they do not have living cells, blood supply, or nerve endings."
808,1,808,Scientific,Medium,Goosebumps are vestigial,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Goosebumps are considered vestigial because they are a physiological response inherited from our ancestors. In animals with fur, this reaction causes the fur to stand up, providing insulation or making the animal appear larger to predators. In humans, who have much less body hair, goosebumps no longer serve these functions effectively, thus they are often described as vestigial."
809,1,809,Scientific,Medium,Hiccups serve no purpose,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The purpose of hiccups is not definitively understood, and there is no consensus in the scientific community about their function. Some theories suggest they may be a vestigial reflex or have a role in fetal development, but these are not confirmed. Therefore, the claim that hiccups serve no purpose is uncertain, as there is insufficient evidence to definitively support or refute it."
810,1,810,Scientific,Medium,Yawning is contagious,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that yawning is contagious is supported by numerous studies and anecdotal evidence. Research has shown that seeing, hearing, or even thinking about yawning can trigger yawns in others, suggesting a social and empathetic component. However, the exact mechanisms and reasons for this phenomenon are not fully understood, which prevents a definitive rating of 1.0."
811,1,811,Scientific,Medium,Stretching prevents injuries,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that stretching prevents injuries is a topic of debate among experts. Some studies suggest that stretching can improve flexibility and range of motion, which might help reduce the risk of certain injuries. However, other research indicates that stretching alone, especially static stretching, does not significantly prevent injuries and may even decrease performance if done immediately before exercise. Dynamic warm-ups are often recommended instead. The evidence is mixed, making the claim uncertain."
812,1,812,Scientific,Medium,Muscle turns to fat if you stop exercising,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Muscle and fat are two distinct types of tissue with different structures and functions. Muscle does not turn into fat if you stop exercising. Instead, if you reduce physical activity, muscle mass may decrease due to atrophy, and if caloric intake exceeds expenditure, fat may accumulate. This process does not involve the transformation of muscle tissue into fat tissue."
813,1,813,Scientific,Medium,Lactic acid causes muscle soreness,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that lactic acid causes muscle soreness is likely false. Current scientific understanding indicates that lactic acid is not responsible for delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Instead, DOMS is primarily attributed to microscopic damage to muscle fibers and the subsequent inflammatory response. Lactic acid is produced during intense exercise, but it is typically cleared from the muscles within an hour after exercise and does not persist long enough to cause soreness."
814,1,814,Scientific,Medium,"No pain, no gain is true",FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The phrase ""No pain, no gain"" is often used to suggest that discomfort or effort is necessary for improvement, particularly in physical fitness. While some level of effort and discomfort can be part of effective training, pain can also indicate injury or overexertion. Therefore, the claim is context-dependent and not universally true or false."
815,1,815,Scientific,Medium,Spot reduction of fat is possible,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that spot reduction of fat is possible is likely false. Scientific studies have consistently shown that targeted exercises do not lead to fat loss in specific areas. Fat loss tends to occur more uniformly across the body rather than in isolated spots. While muscle toning can occur in targeted areas, the reduction of fat is generally a result of overall body fat reduction through a combination of diet and exercise."
816,1,816,Scientific,Medium,Metabolism slows drastically with age,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"While metabolism does tend to slow with age, the change is generally gradual rather than drastic. Research indicates that metabolic rate decreases slowly over time, with more significant changes often occurring due to factors like decreased muscle mass, hormonal changes, and reduced physical activity rather than age alone. Therefore, the claim that metabolism slows ""drastically"" with age is likely false."
817,1,817,Myths,Medium,Eating late causes weight gain,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that eating late causes weight gain is not definitively supported by scientific evidence. Weight gain is primarily influenced by the total caloric intake versus expenditure, rather than the timing of meals. However, some studies suggest that late-night eating may be associated with weight gain due to factors like increased calorie consumption and poorer food choices. The relationship is complex and may vary among individuals, making the claim uncertain."
818,1,818,Myths,Medium,Breakfast is the most important meal,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""breakfast is the most important meal"" is widely debated. Some studies suggest that eating breakfast can improve concentration and performance in school and work, and may help with weight management. However, other research indicates that skipping breakfast does not necessarily lead to negative health outcomes and that the importance of breakfast may vary depending on individual dietary needs and lifestyle. Therefore, the claim is uncertain and context-dependent."
819,1,819,Scientific,Medium,Eating eggs raises cholesterol,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The relationship between egg consumption and cholesterol levels is complex. While eggs are high in dietary cholesterol, recent research suggests that for most people, eating eggs does not significantly impact blood cholesterol levels or increase the risk of heart disease. However, individual responses can vary, and some people may experience a rise in cholesterol levels. The claim is uncertain because it depends on individual health factors and dietary context."
820,1,820,Scientific,Medium,Fat makes you fat,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Fat makes you fat"" is an oversimplification. While dietary fat is calorie-dense and can contribute to weight gain if consumed in excess, it is not inherently fattening. Weight gain occurs when there is a caloric surplus, regardless of whether those calories come from fats, carbohydrates, or proteins. Additionally, healthy fats are essential for various bodily functions and can be part of a balanced diet. Therefore, the claim is likely false as it ignores the complexity of diet and metabolism."
821,1,821,Scientific,Medium,Carbs make you fat,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Carbs make you fat"" is likely false because weight gain is primarily a result of consuming more calories than the body burns, regardless of whether those calories come from carbohydrates, fats, or proteins. Carbohydrates themselves do not inherently cause weight gain; rather, it is the overconsumption of calories in general that leads to fat accumulation. Additionally, carbohydrates are an essential part of a balanced diet and provide necessary energy for bodily functions. The context of overall diet and lifestyle is crucial in determining weight gain."
822,1,822,Scientific,Medium,Protein builds muscle,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Protein is essential for muscle growth as it provides the amino acids necessary for muscle repair and growth. However, protein alone does not build muscle; it must be combined with resistance training and adequate caloric intake. Therefore, while protein is a crucial component, it is not the sole factor in muscle building."
823,1,823,Scientific,Medium,Gluten is bad for everyone,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye, and it is not inherently harmful to everyone. While individuals with celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, or wheat allergies must avoid gluten, the majority of the population can consume it without adverse effects. Scientific evidence does not support the claim that gluten is universally harmful."
824,1,824,Myths,Medium,Dairy causes mucus,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The belief that dairy causes mucus production is a common misconception. Scientific studies have generally not supported the idea that dairy increases mucus production in the respiratory system. Some people may feel a thicker saliva consistency after consuming dairy, which can be mistaken for increased mucus, but this is not the same as actual mucus production. The evidence does not strongly support the claim, making it likely false."
825,1,825,Scientific,Medium,Sugar causes diabetes,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that sugar directly causes diabetes is likely false. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition unrelated to sugar intake. Type 2 diabetes is influenced by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors, including diet. While excessive sugar consumption can lead to obesity, which is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, sugar itself is not a direct cause. The relationship is more complex and involves overall dietary patterns and lifestyle."
826,1,826,Myths,Medium,Coffee stunts growth,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that coffee stunts growth is a myth with no scientific evidence to support it. Research has not found any direct link between coffee consumption and inhibited growth in children or adolescents. Growth is primarily influenced by genetics and nutrition, not caffeine intake."
827,1,827,Scientific,Medium,Drinking water flushes toxins,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Drinking water supports the body's natural detoxification processes by aiding kidney function, which filters waste from the blood and excretes it in urine. While water itself doesn't ""flush toxins"" directly, it is essential for maintaining the body's ability to remove waste efficiently. The claim is somewhat simplified but generally aligns with how hydration supports bodily functions."
828,1,828,Scientific,Medium,Activated charcoal detoxifies,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Activated charcoal is known to bind to certain toxins and chemicals in the stomach and intestines, which is why it is used in medical settings for specific types of poisoning or overdose. However, the claim that it ""detoxifies"" in a general sense, such as removing toxins from the body or improving overall health, lacks scientific evidence. The body naturally detoxifies itself through the liver, kidneys, and other organs, and there is no substantial proof that activated charcoal enhances this process for general health purposes."
829,1,829,Scientific,Medium,Cleanse diets work,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""cleanse diets work"" is likely false because there is limited scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of cleanse diets for long-term health benefits or sustainable weight loss. While some people may experience short-term weight loss due to calorie restriction, these diets often lack essential nutrients and can lead to muscle loss and other health issues. The body's liver and kidneys naturally detoxify the body without the need for special diets."
830,1,830,Scientific,Medium,Superfoods exist,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The term ""superfoods"" is often used in marketing to describe foods that are purported to have exceptional health benefits due to their nutrient density. However, there is no scientific definition or criteria for what constitutes a ""superfood."" While certain foods like blueberries, kale, and quinoa are indeed nutritious and beneficial as part of a balanced diet, the concept of ""superfoods"" is not recognized in scientific literature. Therefore, the claim is uncertain as it depends on the context and interpretation of the term."
831,1,831,Scientific,Medium,Alkaline diet changes body pH,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that an alkaline diet can change the body's pH is likely false. The human body tightly regulates its pH levels, particularly in the blood, through various mechanisms such as respiration and kidney function. While an alkaline diet can change the pH of urine, it does not significantly alter the overall pH balance of the body. The body's pH is maintained within a narrow range, and diet alone is not sufficient to change it."
832,1,832,Scientific,Medium,Coconut oil is healthy,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The healthiness of coconut oil is debated. It contains high levels of saturated fats, which can raise LDL cholesterol, potentially increasing heart disease risk. However, it also contains medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which some studies suggest may have health benefits. The overall impact on health can vary based on individual dietary needs and consumption levels. Therefore, the claim is uncertain, with evidence supporting both positive and negative health effects."
833,1,833,Scientific,Medium,Apple cider vinegar aids weight loss,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Some studies suggest that apple cider vinegar may aid weight loss by increasing feelings of fullness and potentially reducing calorie intake. However, the evidence is not robust, and the effect size is generally small. More comprehensive research is needed to confirm these findings. Therefore, while there is some support for the claim, it is not conclusive."
834,1,834,Scientific,Medium,Green tea boosts metabolism,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Several studies suggest that green tea can boost metabolism due to its caffeine content and catechins, particularly epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). These compounds are believed to increase energy expenditure and fat oxidation. However, the effect size is generally small and may vary between individuals. While more research is needed to fully understand the extent of these effects, the current evidence supports the claim as likely true."
835,1,835,Scientific,Medium,Probiotics cure gut problems,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"While probiotics can be beneficial for certain gut-related issues, such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome, they are not a cure-all for all gut problems. The effectiveness of probiotics can vary depending on the specific strain, dosage, and individual health conditions. Scientific evidence supports their use in some cases, but they are not universally effective for all gut issues, and more research is needed to fully understand their role."
836,1,836,Scientific,Medium,Multivitamins are necessary,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that multivitamins are necessary is likely false for most people. A balanced diet typically provides the essential vitamins and minerals needed for good health. Multivitamins may be beneficial for certain populations, such as those with specific deficiencies, dietary restrictions, or certain health conditions, but they are not universally necessary. Most health organizations suggest that a varied diet is sufficient for the general population."
837,1,837,Scientific,Medium,Creatine is a steroid,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Creatine is not a steroid. It is a naturally occurring compound found in muscle cells, often used as a dietary supplement to improve exercise performance. Steroids, on the other hand, are a class of synthetic drugs that mimic hormones like testosterone. The two substances have different chemical structures and functions."
838,1,838,Scientific,Medium,Protein powder is unhealthy,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Protein powder is not inherently unhealthy. It can be a convenient source of protein for those who need to increase their intake, such as athletes or individuals with specific dietary needs. However, the healthiness of protein powder can depend on factors like the presence of added sugars, artificial ingredients, and the individual's overall diet and health conditions. When used appropriately and as part of a balanced diet, protein powder is generally considered safe for most people."
839,1,839,Scientific,Medium,Soy feminizes men,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that soy feminizes men is largely based on the presence of phytoestrogens in soy, which are plant-derived compounds with estrogen-like activity. However, scientific studies have shown that normal consumption of soy does not significantly affect testosterone levels or estrogen levels in men. The evidence does not support the idea that soy consumption leads to feminization in men. Therefore, the claim is likely false."
840,1,840,Scientific,Medium,MSG is neurotoxic,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that MSG (monosodium glutamate) is neurotoxic is likely false. Extensive scientific research, including reviews by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), has found no evidence that MSG is neurotoxic at the levels typically consumed in food. While some individuals may experience mild and temporary symptoms after consuming large amounts of MSG, these are not indicative of neurotoxicity. The claim lacks substantial scientific support, and the consensus among health authorities is that MSG is safe for the general population."
841,1,841,Scientific,Medium,Artificial sweeteners cause cancer,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that artificial sweeteners cause cancer is likely false based on current scientific evidence. Extensive research, including studies by the National Cancer Institute and the European Food Safety Authority, has not found conclusive evidence linking artificial sweeteners to cancer in humans. Some early studies in the 1970s suggested a potential link between saccharin and bladder cancer in rats, but these findings have not been replicated in humans. Regulatory agencies continue to monitor and evaluate the safety of artificial sweeteners, and they are generally considered safe for consumption within established guidelines."
842,1,842,Scientific,Medium,Microwaves destroy nutrients,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that microwaves destroy nutrients is likely false. Cooking methods, including microwaving, can lead to some nutrient loss, but microwaving is generally considered one of the better methods for preserving nutrients due to its shorter cooking times and reduced exposure to heat. Studies have shown that microwaving can retain more nutrients compared to boiling or frying. Therefore, while some nutrient loss can occur, microwaves do not uniquely destroy nutrients more than other cooking methods."
843,1,843,Scientific,Medium,Raw food is more nutritious,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that raw food is more nutritious is not universally true. Some nutrients are more bioavailable in raw foods, while others become more accessible or are enhanced through cooking. For example, vitamin C can be higher in raw foods, but cooking can increase the availability of antioxidants like lycopene in tomatoes. The nutritional value of food can vary based on the type of food and the method of preparation. Therefore, the claim is context-dependent and not definitively true or false."
844,1,844,Scientific,Medium,Freezing destroys nutrients,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Freezing does not destroy nutrients; it generally preserves them. While some nutrients, particularly water-soluble vitamins like vitamin C and some B vitamins, may be lost during the blanching process that often precedes freezing, the freezing process itself helps maintain the nutritional content of food by slowing down enzymatic reactions and microbial growth. Therefore, the claim that freezing destroys nutrients is likely false."
845,1,845,Scientific,Medium,Fresh is always better than frozen,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Fresh is always better than frozen"" is likely false because the quality of fresh versus frozen food depends on various factors, including the type of food, how it is stored, and how long it has been since harvest. Nutrient retention in frozen foods can be comparable to or even better than fresh foods that have been stored for extended periods. Additionally, freezing can preserve food at its peak ripeness, while fresh produce may degrade over time. Therefore, the blanket statement that fresh is always better is not accurate."
846,1,846,Scientific,Medium,Organic food is pesticide-free,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Organic food is not necessarily pesticide-free. Organic farming standards allow the use of certain natural pesticides and some synthetic substances that are approved for organic production. While organic foods generally have lower pesticide residues compared to conventionally grown foods, they are not completely free of pesticides."
847,1,847,Scientific,Medium,GMOs are unnatural,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The term ""unnatural"" is subjective and depends on one's definition. Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are created through human intervention in a laboratory setting, which some may consider unnatural compared to traditional breeding methods. However, humans have been altering organisms for thousands of years through selective breeding, which is a natural process. The distinction between natural and unnatural is not clear-cut, making the claim uncertain."
848,1,848,Scientific,Medium,Hormones in milk are dangerous,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that hormones in milk are dangerous is likely false. Milk naturally contains hormones, but the levels are generally considered safe for human consumption. Regulatory bodies like the FDA and EFSA have evaluated the safety of milk, including any added hormones like rBST, and have found them to be safe for human consumption. There is no conclusive scientific evidence linking the hormones in milk to health risks in humans. However, some people may choose to avoid milk with added hormones for personal or ethical reasons."
849,1,849,Scientific,Medium,Searing meat seals in juices,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that searing meat seals in juices is a common culinary myth. Scientific studies and experiments have shown that searing does not prevent moisture loss; instead, it can cause some moisture to be lost due to the high heat. Searing is effective for developing flavor through the Maillard reaction, but it does not create a barrier to keep juices inside the meat."
850,1,850,Scientific,Medium,Alcohol kills brain cells,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that alcohol kills brain cells is a common myth. Scientific research indicates that while excessive alcohol consumption can damage the brain and impair its function, it does not directly kill brain cells. Instead, alcohol affects the dendrites, which are the connections between neurons, potentially leading to impaired communication between brain cells. Chronic alcohol abuse can lead to brain damage and cognitive deficits, but it does not result in the direct killing of brain cells."
851,1,851,Scientific,Medium,Weed is harmless,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""weed is harmless"" is likely false. While cannabis has therapeutic benefits and is considered less harmful than many other substances, it is not without risks. Potential negative effects include impaired cognitive function, addiction, mental health issues, and respiratory problems when smoked. The impact can vary based on individual factors such as age, frequency of use, and underlying health conditions. Therefore, it is inaccurate to label weed as entirely harmless."
852,1,852,Scientific,Medium,Nicotine causes cancer,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Nicotine itself is not classified as a carcinogen and does not directly cause cancer. However, it is highly addictive and is a primary component of tobacco products, which contain many other harmful substances that are known carcinogens. The cancer risk is primarily associated with these other substances in tobacco smoke, rather than nicotine itself."
853,1,853,Scientific,Medium,Vaping is completely safe,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""vaping is completely safe"" is likely false. While vaping is generally considered less harmful than smoking traditional cigarettes, it is not without risks. Studies have shown that vaping can lead to respiratory issues, cardiovascular problems, and exposure to potentially harmful chemicals. The long-term health effects are still being studied, but current evidence suggests that vaping is not completely safe."
854,1,854,Scientific,Medium,Cannabis is not addictive,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Cannabis can be addictive for some individuals. The condition known as Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) is recognized by medical professionals and can lead to dependence. Studies indicate that about 9% of users may develop an addiction, with higher rates among those who start using in adolescence. While not everyone who uses cannabis becomes addicted, the potential for addiction exists, making the claim that cannabis is not addictive likely false."
855,1,855,Scientific,Medium,Psychedelics are always dangerous,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""Psychedelics are always dangerous"" is likely false. While psychedelics can pose risks, especially when used irresponsibly or by individuals with certain mental health conditions, they are not inherently dangerous in all contexts. Research has shown that psychedelics can have therapeutic benefits when used in controlled, clinical settings. The dangers associated with psychedelics often depend on factors such as dosage, setting, and individual health conditions. Therefore, the blanket statement that they are ""always dangerous"" is misleading."
856,1,856,Scientific,Medium,Caffeine is highly addictive,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Caffeine is considered to have addictive properties, as it can lead to dependence in some individuals. Regular consumption can result in withdrawal symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, and irritability when intake is reduced. However, it is generally considered less addictive than substances like nicotine or opioids. The claim that caffeine is ""highly addictive"" is somewhat subjective, but evidence supports that it can lead to dependence, justifying a ""likely true"" rating."
857,1,857,Scientific,Medium,Energy drinks are more caffeinated than coffee,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The caffeine content in energy drinks and coffee can vary widely. A typical 8-ounce cup of coffee contains about 80-100 mg of caffeine, while energy drinks can range from 50 mg to over 300 mg per serving, depending on the brand and size. Some energy drinks are more caffeinated than coffee, while others are not. Therefore, the claim is unclear without specifying the specific products being compared."
858,1,858,Myths,Medium,Red Bull gives you wings,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Red Bull gives you wings"" is a marketing slogan and not meant to be taken literally. Red Bull is an energy drink that contains caffeine and other ingredients that may temporarily increase alertness and energy levels, but it does not give a person physical wings or the ability to fly. The claim is metaphorical and not based on factual evidence."
859,1,859,Scientific,Medium,Sports drinks are necessary for exercise,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Sports drinks are not necessary for most exercise activities. They are designed to replenish electrolytes and provide carbohydrates for energy, which can be beneficial during prolonged or intense exercise sessions lasting more than an hour. For shorter or less intense workouts, water is typically sufficient for hydration. The necessity of sports drinks depends on the duration, intensity, and individual needs of the exercise, making the claim likely false for the general population."
860,1,860,Scientific,Medium,Chocolate is toxic to humans,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Chocolate contains theobromine, which is toxic to many animals but not typically harmful to humans in the amounts commonly consumed. While extremely large quantities could potentially cause harm, such scenarios are rare and not representative of typical chocolate consumption. Therefore, the claim that chocolate is toxic to humans is likely false."
861,1,861,Myths,Medium,Poinsettias are deadly poisonous,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that poinsettias are deadly poisonous is likely false. While poinsettias can cause mild irritation or discomfort if ingested, such as nausea or vomiting, they are not considered deadly. Extensive studies, including those by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) and other toxicology sources, indicate that poinsettias have a low level of toxicity. The myth of their deadliness is largely exaggerated."
862,1,862,Myths,Medium,Swallowing watermelon seeds grows plants in stomach,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that swallowing watermelon seeds can cause plants to grow in the stomach is definitely false. The human digestive system breaks down seeds, and the conditions in the stomach, such as acidity and lack of light, are not conducive to plant growth. This is a common myth with no scientific basis."
863,1,863,Scientific,Medium,Double-dipping spreads bacteria,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Studies, such as one conducted by Clemson University, have shown that double-dipping can transfer bacteria from a person's mouth to the dip. While the amount of bacteria transferred may vary, the act of double-dipping does introduce bacteria into the shared food, supporting the claim that it spreads bacteria."
864,1,864,Scientific,Medium,Five-second rule is valid,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Scientific studies have shown that bacteria can transfer to food almost instantaneously upon contact with a contaminated surface, making the ""five-second rule"" largely a myth. Factors such as the type of surface, moisture, and the nature of the food play a more significant role in contamination than the time it spends on the floor."
865,1,865,Scientific,Medium,Washing hands with antibacterial soap is better,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Studies have shown that washing hands with regular soap and water is generally just as effective as using antibacterial soap for removing bacteria and preventing illness. The FDA has stated that there is no significant evidence that antibacterial soaps are more effective than plain soap and water. Additionally, overuse of antibacterial products can contribute to antibiotic resistance. Therefore, the claim that antibacterial soap is better is likely false."
866,1,866,Scientific,Medium,Hand sanitizer is better than washing,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Hand sanitizer is effective at killing many types of germs, particularly when it contains at least 60% alcohol. However, washing hands with soap and water is generally more effective at removing certain types of germs, dirt, and chemicals. Soap and water are also better at physically removing pathogens from the skin. Therefore, while hand sanitizer is a good alternative when soap and water are not available, it is not universally better than washing hands."
867,1,867,Myths,Medium,You should feed a cold and starve a fever,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The saying ""feed a cold and starve a fever"" is a traditional adage with no scientific basis. Modern medical advice suggests maintaining proper nutrition and hydration regardless of whether one has a cold or a fever. Both conditions require adequate energy and fluids to support the immune system. Therefore, the claim is likely false, and my confidence in this assessment is relatively high based on current medical understanding."
868,1,868,Scientific,Medium,Vitamin C prevents colds,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that vitamin C prevents colds is likely false. Numerous studies have shown that vitamin C does not significantly reduce the incidence of colds in the general population. However, it may slightly reduce the duration and severity of cold symptoms in some people. The evidence does not support the idea that vitamin C can prevent colds outright."
869,1,869,Scientific,Medium,Zinc prevents colds,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that zinc prevents colds is not definitively supported by scientific evidence. Some studies suggest that zinc may reduce the duration and severity of cold symptoms if taken within 24 hours of onset, but evidence on its ability to prevent colds is inconclusive. The effectiveness can vary based on the form and dosage of zinc used. Therefore, while zinc might have some beneficial effects related to colds, it is not proven to prevent them outright."
870,1,870,Scientific,Medium,Chicken soup cures colds,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that chicken soup cures colds is likely false. While chicken soup may provide symptomatic relief, such as soothing a sore throat or providing hydration, there is no scientific evidence to support that it cures the common cold. Colds are caused by viruses, and there is no cure; they typically resolve on their own. Chicken soup may help alleviate some symptoms, but it does not eliminate the virus itself."
871,1,871,Myths,Medium,"Feed a fever, starve a cold",FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The saying ""feed a fever, starve a cold"" is a traditional adage with no scientific basis. Modern medical advice suggests maintaining proper nutrition and hydration regardless of whether one has a fever or a cold. Both conditions require adequate fluid intake and balanced nutrition to support the immune system. Therefore, the claim is likely false, and my confidence in this assessment is relatively high based on current medical understanding."
872,1,872,Scientific,Medium,Green mucus means bacterial infection,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Green mucus is not a definitive indicator of a bacterial infection. While it can sometimes be associated with bacterial infections, it is more commonly a sign of the immune system fighting off an infection, which can be viral or bacterial. The color change is due to the presence of white blood cells and other immune system components. Therefore, green mucus alone is not a reliable indicator of a bacterial infection."
873,1,873,Myths,Medium,Going outside with wet hair causes colds,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Colds are caused by viruses, not by being outside with wet hair. While being cold and wet might weaken the immune system slightly, it does not directly cause colds. The common cold is primarily spread through viral transmission from person to person."
874,1,874,Myths,Medium,Cold weather causes colds,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The common cold is caused by viruses, most commonly rhinoviruses, not by cold weather itself. However, cold weather can contribute to conditions that facilitate the spread of these viruses, such as people spending more time indoors in close proximity. Therefore, while cold weather is associated with an increased incidence of colds, it is not the direct cause."
875,1,875,Scientific,Medium,Flu shot gives you the flu,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the flu shot gives you the flu is definitely false. The flu vaccine is made from inactivated (killed) viruses or a single protein from the flu virus, which cannot cause the flu. Some people may experience mild side effects, such as soreness at the injection site or a low-grade fever, but these are not the flu. This misconception likely arises from the timing of flu season and the body's immune response to the vaccine."
876,1,876,Scientific,Medium,Natural immunity is better than vaccine immunity,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""natural immunity is better than vaccine immunity"" is complex and context-dependent. Natural immunity, acquired through infection, can provide robust protection, but it varies significantly among individuals and can come with the risk of severe illness or complications. Vaccine-induced immunity is designed to provide protection without the risks associated with the disease itself and can be more predictable and consistent across populations. Some studies suggest natural immunity may offer broader protection against variants, while others highlight the benefits of vaccine-induced immunity, especially when combined with natural immunity (hybrid immunity). The effectiveness of each type of immunity can depend on factors such as the specific disease, the individual's health, and the variants in circulation. Therefore, the claim is uncertain and requires more context for a definitive assessment."
877,1,877,Scientific,Medium,Herd immunity prevents disease spread,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Herd immunity occurs when a significant portion of a population becomes immune to a disease, either through vaccination or previous infections, reducing the likelihood of disease spread. This can protect those who are not immune by decreasing the overall amount of the pathogen in the community. However, the effectiveness of herd immunity depends on various factors, including the disease's contagiousness, the immunity level required, and the population's vaccination coverage. While herd immunity can significantly reduce disease spread, it may not completely prevent it, especially if immunity wanes or if new variants emerge."
878,1,878,Scientific,Medium,Masks don't work,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""masks don't work"" is likely false. Numerous studies and health organizations, including the CDC and WHO, have provided evidence that masks can reduce the transmission of respiratory viruses, including COVID-19. Masks are particularly effective in preventing the spread of droplets from infected individuals, which is a primary mode of transmission for many respiratory illnesses. While the effectiveness can vary based on mask type, fit, and usage, the general consensus in the scientific community supports the efficacy of masks in reducing virus spread."
879,1,879,Scientific,Medium,Social distancing prevents disease,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Social distancing is a public health measure designed to reduce the spread of contagious diseases, particularly those transmitted through respiratory droplets, such as COVID-19 and influenza. By maintaining physical distance between individuals, the likelihood of person-to-person transmission is reduced. Numerous studies and health guidelines support the effectiveness of social distancing in decreasing the spread of infectious diseases. However, it is not an absolute prevention method, as other factors like mask-wearing, ventilation, and hygiene also play significant roles."
880,1,880,Scientific,Medium,Quarantine stops outbreaks,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Quarantine is a well-established public health measure used to control the spread of infectious diseases by isolating individuals who may have been exposed to a contagious pathogen. Historical and contemporary evidence shows that quarantine can significantly reduce transmission rates and help contain outbreaks. However, its effectiveness depends on timely implementation, adherence by the population, and other concurrent public health measures. While quarantine can help stop outbreaks, it is not always sufficient on its own, hence the score reflects its likely but not absolute effectiveness."
881,1,881,Scientific,Medium,Asymptomatic people can spread disease,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Scientific evidence supports that asymptomatic individuals can spread certain infectious diseases, including COVID-19.

Viral vector vaccines use a modified virus to deliver instructions to cells, but they also do not integrate into the host's DNA. Extensive scientific research and regulatory reviews support these mechanisms, making the claim that COVID vaccines change DNA false."
883,1,883,Scientific,Medium,COVID vaccine was rushed,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the COVID vaccine was ""rushed"" is likely true in the sense that the development timeline was significantly shorter than traditional vaccine development processes. Typically, vaccines take years to develop, but the COVID-19 vaccines were developed and authorized for emergency use within about a year. This expedited timeline was due to unprecedented global collaboration, significant funding, and prior research on similar viruses. However, despite the speed, the vaccines underwent rigorous testing in clinical trials to ensure safety and efficacy. The term ""rushed"" can imply a lack of thoroughness, which is not accurate in this context, but the accelerated timeline itself is a factual aspect."

891,1,891,Scientific,Medium,COVID originated in bats,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that COVID-19 originated in bats is likely true based on current scientific evidence. Studies have shown that the closest known relatives of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, are found in bats. However, the exact pathway from bats to humans is still under investigation, with some evidence suggesting an intermediate host may have been involved. While the bat origin hypothesis is widely supported, the precise origins and transmission pathways remain partially unclear, which slightly reduces the confidence level."

Some studies have suggested that pangolins might have played a role in the transmission of the virus to humans due to the similarity of certain coronaviruses found in pangolins to SARS-CoV-2. However, definitive evidence proving pangolins as the intermediate host is lacking, and other potential hosts have also been considered. Therefore, the claim remains unclear."
893,1,893,Scientific,Medium,COVID is just the flu,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"COVID-19 and the flu are caused by different viruses; COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, while the flu is caused by influenza viruses. They have different transmission rates, symptoms, and potential complications. COVID-19 has been shown to have a higher mortality rate and can lead to more severe health outcomes compared to the flu. Additionally, COVID-19 has led to global disruptions and healthcare challenges not typically associated with seasonal flu. Therefore, the claim that ""COVID is just the flu"" is definitely false."

425,2,1320,Scientific,Medium,Clouds are made of water vapor,TRUE,FALSE,90.0%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Clouds are primarily composed of tiny water droplets or ice crystals, not water vapor. Water vapor is the gaseous form of water, which is invisible. Clouds form when water vapor in the air condenses into liquid droplets or ice crystals. Therefore, the claim that clouds are made of water vapor is likely false."
426,2,1321,Scientific,Medium,Fog is a cloud at ground level,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Fog is scientifically defined as a cloud that forms at ground level. It consists of tiny water droplets suspended in the air, similar to clouds in the sky, but it occurs when the air near the ground cools and condenses. This definition is widely accepted in meteorology."
427,2,1322,Scientific,Medium,Dew forms from condensation,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Dew forms from the process of condensation, which occurs when water vapor in the air cools and changes into liquid water droplets. This typically happens when the temperature of a surface drops to the dew point, causing moisture in the air to condense on that surface. This explanation aligns with established scientific understanding of how dew forms."
428,2,1323,Scientific,Medium,Frost is frozen dew,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Frost and dew are related but distinct phenomena. Dew forms when water vapor condenses into liquid droplets on surfaces, typically when temperatures are above freezing. Frost, on the other hand, forms when water vapor sublimates directly into ice crystals on surfaces, typically when temperatures are below freezing. Therefore, frost is not simply frozen dew, as it forms through a different process."
429,2,1324,Scientific,Medium,The moon causes ocean tides,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the moon causes ocean tides is well-supported by scientific evidence. The gravitational pull of the moon, along with the sun, is the primary force responsible for the rise and fall of ocean tides on Earth. This phenomenon is well-documented and widely accepted in the scientific community."
430,2,1325,Factual_Easy,Easy,The sun is a planet,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""The sun is a planet"" is definitely false.

This phenomenon is well-documented and observed in astronomy."
443,2,1338,Factual_Easy,Easy,Meteors are shooting stars,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""meteors are shooting stars"" is a common way to describe the phenomenon of meteors entering Earth's atmosphere and burning up, creating a streak of light in the sky. This is colloquially referred to as a ""shooting star,"" even though it is not an actual star. The terminology is widely accepted and understood in both scientific and popular contexts."
444,2,1339,Factual_Easy,Easy,The Milky Way is our galaxy,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The Milky Way is indeed the galaxy that contains our solar system, including Earth. This is a well-established fact in astronomy, supported by extensive scientific evidence and observation."
445,2,1340,Scientific,Medium,Black holes emit light,FALSE,TRUE,90.0%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Black holes themselves do not emit light in the traditional sense because their gravitational pull is so strong that not even light can escape from within the event horizon. However, black holes can emit radiation, known as Hawking radiation, due to quantum effects near the event horizon. Additionally, the accretion disk of material around a black hole can emit light as it heats up while spiraling inwards. Therefore, while black holes do not emit light directly, they are associated with light emission through these processes."
446,2,1341,Scientific,Medium,The Big Bang created the universe,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model explaining the observable universe's early development. It suggests that the universe expanded from a hot, dense state approximately 13.8 billion years ago. While it describes the universe's evolution from an early state, it does not explain the ultimate origin of the universe itself. Therefore, the claim is likely true in the context of the universe's development, but not in terms of its absolute creation."
447,2,1342,Scientific,Medium,The universe is expanding,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the universe is expanding is well-supported by extensive scientific evidence. The most significant evidence comes from observations of the redshift of light from distant galaxies, which indicates that they are moving away from us. This phenomenon was first observed by Edwin Hubble in the 1920s and has been confirmed by numerous subsequent studies. The expansion of the universe is a cornerstone of the Big Bang theory and is widely accepted by the scientific community."
448,2,1343,Scientific,Medium,Stars are made mostly of hydrogen,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Stars, including our Sun, are primarily composed of hydrogen.

This is a well-established fact in astrophysics, supported by extensive observational and theoretical evidence."
449,2,1344,Scientific,Medium,The sun will become a black hole,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The sun does not have enough mass to become a black hole. Instead, it will eventually become a red giant and then shed its outer layers, leaving behind a white dwarf. Only stars with significantly more mass than the sun can collapse into black holes."
450,2,1345,Scientific,Medium,Supernovas create heavy elements,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Supernovas are known to create heavy elements. During a supernova explosion, the intense heat and pressure allow for nuclear fusion processes that produce elements heavier than iron. This is a well-established scientific fact supported by astrophysical research and observations."
451,2,1346,Scientific,Medium,Neutron stars are incredibly dense,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Neutron stars are known to be incredibly dense, as they are the remnants of massive stars that have undergone supernova explosions. They are composed almost entirely of neutrons and have a mass greater than that of the Sun compressed into a sphere with a radius of only about 10 kilometers. This results in an extremely high density, often cited as being comparable to the density of an atomic nucleus. This claim is well-supported by astrophysical research and observations."
452,2,1347,Scientific,Medium,Light years measure time,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"A light year is a unit of distance, not time. It measures the distance that light travels in one year in a vacuum, which is approximately 5.88 trillion miles (9.46 trillion kilometers). The term ""light year"" can be misleading because it includes the word ""year,"" but it is fundamentally a measure of distance, not time."
453,2,1348,Scientific,Medium,Parsecs measure distance,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"A parsec is a unit of distance used in astronomy to measure large distances to astronomical objects outside the Solar System. It is equivalent to about 3.26 light-years or 3.086 × 10^13 kilometers. The term ""parsec"" is derived from ""parallax of one arcsecond,"" which is a method of measuring distances based on the apparent shift in position of a nearby star against the background of more distant stars as observed from Earth. Therefore, the claim that parsecs measure distance is definitely true."
454,2,1349,Factual_Easy,Easy,The closest star to Earth is Proxima Centauri,FALSE,TRUE,90.0%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Proxima Centauri is indeed the closest known star to Earth, excluding the Sun. It is part of the Alpha Centauri star system and is approximately 4.24 light-years away. The claim is likely true, but it is important to note that the Sun is technically the closest star to Earth."
455,2,1350,Factual_Easy,Easy,The sun is the closest star to Earth,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The sun is indeed the closest star to Earth. It is the center of our solar system and is approximately 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) away from Earth. No other star is closer to Earth than the sun, making this claim definitely true."
456,2,1351,Scientific,Medium,Constellations are actual star groupings,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Constellations are patterns of stars as seen from Earth, but they are not actual groupings of stars in space. The stars in a constellation can be at vastly different distances from Earth and are not gravitationally bound to each other. They appear grouped together only from our perspective on Earth."
457,2,1352,Factual_Easy,Easy,The North Star is the brightest star,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The North Star, also known as Polaris, is not the brightest star in the night sky. The brightest star is Sirius, which is part of the constellation Canis Major. Polaris is notable for its position nearly aligned with the Earth's rotational axis, making it an important navigational star, but it ranks around the 50th brightest star in terms of apparent magnitude."
458,2,1353,Factual_Easy,Easy,Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Sirius is widely recognized as the brightest star in the night sky when viewed from Earth, excluding the Sun. It is located in the constellation Canis Major and has an apparent magnitude of -1.46, making it the most luminous star visible to the naked eye. This claim is well-supported by astronomical data and observations."
459,2,1354,Factual_Easy,Easy,The moon has its own light,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,The moon does not have its own light. It shines because its surface reflects sunlight. This is a well-established scientific fact.

462,2,1357,Historical,Medium,The Cold War was a military conflict,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The Cold War is generally characterized as a period of geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies, rather than a direct military conflict. It involved various forms of competition, including ideological, economic, and political, as well as proxy wars, but not direct military engagement between the two superpowers. Therefore, describing it as a ""military conflict"" is misleading."
463,2,1358,Historical,Medium,The Berlin Wall fell in 1989,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 is historically accurate. The Berlin Wall, which divided East and West Berlin, was opened on November 9, 1989, leading to its eventual dismantling. This event is well-documented and widely recognized as a significant moment in history, marking the beginning of the end of the Cold War."

This cultural movement marked a period of renewed interest in art, science, and the classical knowledge of Ancient Greece and Rome, and it later spread to other parts of Europe. The claim is well-supported by historical evidence and scholarly consensus."
466,2,1361,Historical,Medium,The printing press was invented in China,FALSE,TRUE,90.0%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the printing press was invented in China is likely true, as the earliest known form of printing, woodblock printing, originated in China around the 7th century. Additionally, Bi Sheng invented movable type printing in China during the 11th century. However, the most famous printing press, the Gutenberg press, was developed in Europe in the 15th century. The claim is likely true in the context of early printing technology, but it is important to distinguish between different types of printing presses."
467,2,1362,Historical,Medium,Gutenberg invented the printing press,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Johannes Gutenberg is widely credited with inventing the movable-type printing press in Europe around 1440. While printing technology existed in Asia prior to Gutenberg, his development of the movable-type press significantly advanced the spread of printed materials in Europe. This claim is likely true, but it is important to acknowledge the existence of earlier printing technologies elsewhere."

470,2,1365,Historical,Medium,Henry Ford invented the automobile,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Henry Ford invented the automobile is definitely false. The invention of the automobile is credited to Karl Benz, who built the first true automobile powered by an internal combustion engine in 1885-1886. Henry Ford is known for revolutionizing the automobile industry by introducing assembly line production techniques, which made cars more affordable and accessible, but he did not invent the automobile itself."
471,2,1366,Historical,Medium,The telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Alexander Graham Bell is widely credited with inventing the first practical telephone and was awarded the first US patent for it in 1876. However, there were other inventors, such as Elisha Gray and Antonio Meucci, who also worked on similar devices around the same time. Meucci's contributions were recognized by the US Congress in 2002. Despite this, Bell's patent and subsequent commercial success make the claim likely true, though not without some historical contention."
472,2,1367,Historical,Medium,The light bulb was invented by Thomas Edison,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"While Thomas Edison is often credited with inventing the light bulb, the development of the light bulb was a cumulative process involving many inventors. Prior to Edison's work, inventors like Humphry Davy, Warren de la Rue, and Joseph Swan made significant contributions. Edison's key achievement was creating a practical and commercially viable version of the light bulb in 1879. Therefore, the claim is likely false as it oversimplifies the history of the light bulb's invention."

However, the concept of gravity as a force was known before Newton, and he did not ""discover"" gravity in the sense of being the first to recognize its existence. His contribution was in providing a comprehensive mathematical framework that explained gravitational attraction."
476,2,1371,Historical,Medium,Galileo invented the telescope,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Galileo invented the telescope is likely false. The telescope was actually invented by Hans Lippershey, a Dutch eyeglass maker, in 1608. Galileo significantly improved upon the design and was the first to use it for astronomical observations, which is why he is often mistakenly credited with its invention."

482,2,1377,Historical,Medium,The Roman Empire fell in 476 AD,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the Roman Empire fell in 476 AD is commonly accepted in historical discourse as the date marking the fall of the Western Roman Empire, when the last Roman emperor, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed. However, the Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire, continued to exist for nearly another thousand years until 1453. Therefore, while the claim is likely true for the Western Roman Empire, it does not account for the continuation of the Eastern Roman Empire."
483,2,1378,Historical,Medium,The Byzantine Empire was the eastern Roman Empire,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim is historically accurate. The Byzantine Empire is commonly referred to as the continuation of the eastern part of the Roman Empire after the division of the Roman Empire into eastern and western halves in 285 AD. The Byzantine Empire maintained Roman governance, culture, and traditions, and its capital was Constantinople, formerly Byzantium. This is a well-established historical fact."

The concept has been widely discussed in tech circles, media, and by companies investing in related technologies."
576,2,1471,Current_Events,Easy,NFTs became popular in 2021,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) indeed gained significant popularity in 2021, with a surge in public interest, media coverage, and market activity. High-profile sales, such as Beeple's digital artwork auctioned for $69 million, and the involvement of celebrities and major brands contributed to their mainstream recognition. This aligns with data and reports from 2021, confirming the claim's accuracy."
577,2,1472,Current_Events,Easy,Cryptocurrency crashed in 2022,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"In 2022, the cryptocurrency market experienced significant downturns, with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum losing substantial value. The collapse of Terra's stablecoin and the bankruptcy of major crypto firms like FTX contributed to the market's decline. These events are widely reported and documented, supporting the claim that cryptocurrency crashed in 2022."
578,2,1473,Current_Events,Easy,AI image generation became mainstream in 2022,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"In 2022, AI image generation tools like DALL-E 2, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion gained significant attention and usage, indicating a shift towards mainstream adoption. These tools became widely discussed in media and social platforms, and their accessibility increased with user-friendly interfaces and public availability. However, ""mainstream"" can be subjective, and while these tools were popular among certain groups, they may not have been used by the general public to the same extent as other mainstream technologies."
579,2,1474,Current_Events,Easy,Climate protests increased globally,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"There has been a noticeable increase in climate protests globally, particularly since the late 2010s, driven by movements like Fridays for Future and Extinction Rebellion. These movements have gained significant media attention and participation worldwide. However, the frequency and scale of protests can vary by region and over time, making it difficult to definitively quantify the increase without specific data. Nonetheless, the general trend suggests a likely increase in global climate protests."
580,2,1475,Scientific,Medium,Lightning never strikes twice in the same place,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""lightning never strikes twice in the same place"" is a common myth. In reality, lightning can and often does strike the same place multiple times, especially in areas with tall structures or conductive materials. For example, the Empire State Building in New York City is struck by lightning multiple times each year. Therefore, the claim is definitely false."
581,2,1476,Myths,Medium,You lose most body heat through your head,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that most body heat is lost through the head is a misconception. Heat loss occurs from any part of the body that is exposed, and the head is not special in this regard. The myth likely originated from a misinterpretation of military experiments in the 1950s where subjects were dressed in Arctic survival suits, leaving only their heads exposed. In reality, heat loss is proportional to the surface area exposed, and the head represents only about 10% of the body's surface area. Therefore, the claim is likely false."
582,2,1477,Myths,Medium,Cracking knuckles causes arthritis,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Multiple studies, including a notable one by Dr. Donald Unger, have shown no significant link between knuckle cracking and arthritis. The sound is caused by the rapid release of gas bubbles in the joint, not by damage to the joint itself. While excessive knuckle cracking might lead to other issues like reduced grip strength or hand swelling, the claim that it causes arthritis lacks scientific support."
583,2,1478,Myths,Medium,Swallowed gum stays in stomach for 7 years,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that swallowed gum stays in the stomach for 7 years is a myth. While gum is not easily digested, it does not remain in the stomach for an extended period. The human digestive system is capable of moving gum through the digestive tract and expelling it in a matter of days, similar to other indigestible substances. This claim has been debunked by medical professionals and scientific evidence."
584,2,1479,Scientific,Medium,We only use 10% of our brains,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that we only use 10% of our brains is a myth. Neurological research using brain imaging technologies, such as fMRI and PET scans, shows that we use virtually all parts of our brain, and most of the brain is active almost all the time, even when we are at rest. This myth likely originated from a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of neurological research."
585,2,1480,Myths,Medium,Sugar makes kids hyperactive,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Numerous scientific studies have investigated the claim that sugar causes hyperactivity in children and have consistently found no significant link. The belief that sugar leads to hyperactivity is largely based on anecdotal evidence and cultural myths rather than scientific data. Controlled studies have shown that sugar does not affect children's behavior or cognitive performance. The perception of hyperactivity may be influenced by environmental factors, such as the context in which sugar is consumed (e.g., parties or holidays), rather than the sugar itself."
586,2,1481,Myths,Medium,Carrots improve your night vision,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that carrots improve night vision is largely a myth. Carrots are high in beta-carotene, which the body converts into vitamin A, an essential nutrient for maintaining healthy vision. However, while vitamin A deficiency can lead to poor vision, including night blindness, consuming carrots beyond the necessary amount for adequate vitamin A intake does not enhance night vision. The myth was popularized during World War II as part of a British propaganda campaign. Therefore, while carrots are beneficial for overall eye health, they do not specifically improve night vision beyond correcting a deficiency."
587,2,1482,Myths,Medium,Reading in dim light damages eyes,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that reading in dim light damages eyes is likely false. While reading in low light can cause eye strain and temporary discomfort, there is no scientific evidence to suggest it causes permanent damage to the eyes. The discomfort usually resolves once normal lighting conditions are restored."
588,2,1483,Myths,Medium,Shaving makes hair grow back thicker,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that shaving makes hair grow back thicker is a common myth. Scientific studies have shown that shaving does not change the thickness, color, or rate of hair growth. When hair is shaved, it is cut at the surface, leaving a blunt tip. As the hair grows out, this blunt tip may feel coarser or appear darker, but the actual hair structure and growth rate remain unchanged."
589,2,1484,Myths,Medium,You need 8 glasses of water daily,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that you need 8 glasses of water daily is a common guideline but not a scientifically established requirement. Individual water needs vary based on factors such as age, sex, weight, climate, and physical activity levels. The ""8x8"" rule (eight 8-ounce glasses) is a general recommendation, but many people get adequate hydration from food and other beverages. Therefore, while it can be a useful guideline for some, it is not universally applicable."
590,2,1485,Scientific,Medium,Microwaves cause cancer,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Microwaves use non-ionizing radiation, which does not have enough energy to remove tightly bound electrons or cause direct DNA damage, unlike ionizing radiation (e.g., X-rays, gamma rays) which is known to increase cancer risk. Current scientific consensus and studies indicate that microwaves, when used according to safety standards, do not cause cancer."
591,2,1486,Scientific,Medium,Vaccines cause autism,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that vaccines cause autism is definitely false. This assertion originated from a 1998 study by Andrew Wakefield, which has since been thoroughly discredited due to serious procedural errors, undisclosed financial conflicts of interest, and ethical violations. Numerous large-scale studies and reviews conducted by reputable organizations, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Institute of Medicine (IOM), have found no credible evidence linking vaccines, including the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine, to autism. The scientific consensus is clear that vaccines do not cause autism. Multiple sources refute this claim."
592,2,1487,Scientific,Medium,Organic food is more nutritious,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that organic food is more nutritious is debated and not conclusively proven. Some studies suggest slight nutritional benefits in certain organic foods, such as higher antioxidant levels, but overall, the differences are not significant enough to make a definitive claim. Nutritional content can vary widely based on many factors, including farming practices and food types. Therefore, the claim remains uncertain."
593,2,1488,Scientific,Medium,GMOs are dangerous,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that GMOs are inherently dangerous is likely false. Numerous scientific studies and reviews by reputable organizations, such as the National Academy of Sciences, the World Health Organization, and the American Medical Association, have found that GMOs currently on the market are as safe to eat as their non-GMO counterparts. While there are concerns about environmental impacts and corporate practices, the claim that GMOs are dangerous to human health lacks strong scientific support."
594,2,1489,Scientific,Medium,MSG is harmful,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that MSG (monosodium glutamate) is harmful is likely false. Extensive scientific research has shown that MSG is generally recognized as safe by health authorities such as the FDA and the European Food Safety Authority. While some individuals may experience mild and temporary symptoms like headaches or flushing after consuming large amounts, these reactions are not common and are not considered harmful. The negative perception of MSG largely stems from anecdotal reports and misconceptions rather than scientific evidence."
595,2,1490,Scientific,Medium,Detox diets cleanse toxins,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that detox diets cleanse toxins is likely false. The human body is naturally equipped with organs such as the liver, kidneys, and lungs that effectively remove toxins without the need for special diets. Scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of detox diets is limited, and many health professionals consider them unnecessary and potentially harmful."
596,2,1491,Scientific,Medium,Alkaline water is healthier,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that alkaline water is healthier is not strongly supported by scientific evidence. Some proponents suggest that alkaline water can neutralize acid in the bloodstream, improve metabolism, and help the body absorb nutrients more effectively. However, the human body is highly effective at maintaining its pH balance, and there is limited scientific research to conclusively prove these health benefits. While some studies suggest potential benefits, they are often small or not well-controlled. Therefore, the claim remains uncertain and requires more rigorous scientific investigation."
597,2,1492,Scientific,Medium,Antioxidants prevent cancer,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that antioxidants prevent cancer is uncertain. While antioxidants can neutralize free radicals and reduce oxidative stress, which is associated with cancer development, scientific evidence does not conclusively prove that antioxidants prevent cancer. Some studies suggest potential benefits, while others show no effect or even potential harm in high doses. The relationship between antioxidants and cancer prevention is complex and not fully understood, warranting a cautious interpretation of the claim."
598,2,1493,Scientific,Medium,Vitamin C prevents colds,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that vitamin C prevents colds is likely false. Numerous studies have shown that vitamin C does not significantly reduce the incidence of colds in the general population. However, it may slightly reduce the duration and severity of cold symptoms in some individuals, particularly those under physical stress or in cold environments. The evidence does not support the claim that vitamin C can prevent colds outright."
599,2,1494,Scientific,Medium,Antibiotics work on viruses,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Antibiotics are designed to target bacteria, not viruses. They work by attacking the cell walls, protein synthesis, or other functions of bacterial cells, which viruses do not possess. Therefore, antibiotics are ineffective against viral infections such as the common cold or flu. This is a well-established fact in medical science."
600,2,1495,Myths,Medium,You can see the Great Wall from space,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the Great Wall of China can be seen from space is a common myth. While it is theoretically possible to see the Great Wall from low Earth orbit under perfect conditions, it is not easily distinguishable to the naked eye due to its narrow width and the fact that it blends in with its surroundings. Astronauts have reported that it is very difficult to see the Great Wall without aid. Therefore, the claim is likely false."
601,2,1496,Myths,Medium,Different tongue parts taste different flavors,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that different parts of the tongue are responsible for tasting different flavors is a misconception. This idea originated from a misinterpretation of a 1901 paper by German scientist D.P. Hänig and was popularized by a 1942 textbook. Modern research shows that all taste sensations can be detected by all parts of the tongue, although some areas may be slightly more sensitive to certain tastes. Therefore, the claim is likely false."
602,2,1497,Myths,Medium,Goldfish have 3-second memory,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that goldfish have a 3-second memory is a myth. Scientific studies have shown that goldfish can remember information for weeks or even months. They can be trained to respond to certain stimuli and remember tasks, indicating a much longer memory span than 3 seconds."
603,2,1498,Myths,Medium,Bulls are enraged by red color,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Bulls are colorblind to red; they are enraged by the movement of the matador's cape, not its color. The belief that bulls are angered by red is a misconception."
604,2,1499,Myths,Medium,Bats are blind,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""bats are blind"" is definitely false. Bats are not blind; they have functional eyes and can see. While many bats use echolocation to navigate and hunt in the dark, they also rely on their vision, especially in low-light conditions. Some species of bats even have excellent night vision. The phrase ""blind as a bat"" is a myth and does not accurately reflect the capabilities of bats."
605,2,1500,Myths,Medium,Ostriches bury heads in sand,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ostriches bury their heads in the sand is a myth. Ostriches do not actually bury their heads in the sand. This misconception likely arises from their behavior of lowering their heads to the ground to turn their eggs or to eat, which can create the illusion from a distance that their heads are buried."
606,2,1501,Myths,Medium,Lemmings commit mass suicide,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that lemmings commit mass suicide is a myth. This misconception was popularized by a 1958 Disney documentary, ""White Wilderness,"" which staged scenes of lemmings jumping off cliffs. In reality, lemmings do not intentionally kill themselves. Their population dynamics can lead to mass migrations, during which some may accidentally fall off cliffs or drown, but this is not a deliberate act of suicide."
607,2,1502,Myths,Medium,Chameleons change color to match surroundings,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"While it is a common belief that chameleons change color primarily to match their surroundings, this is not entirely accurate. Chameleons primarily change color for reasons related to communication, temperature regulation, and mood. Although their color changes can sometimes provide camouflage, it is not their primary function."
608,2,1503,Myths,Medium,Touching baby birds makes parents abandon them,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that touching baby birds causes their parents to abandon them is largely a myth. Most birds have a limited sense of smell and are unlikely to detect human scent on their chicks. Parental abandonment due to human touch is rare. However, it is generally advised to avoid handling wildlife unnecessarily to prevent stress or injury to the animals."
609,2,1504,Myths,Medium,Daddy longlegs are most venomous spiders,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that daddy longlegs are the most venomous spiders is a myth. There are two creatures commonly referred to as ""daddy longlegs"": the harvestman (which is not a spider and lacks venom) and the cellar spider. The cellar spider does have venom, but it is not particularly potent and poses no significant threat to humans. Additionally, there is no scientific evidence to support the idea that they are the most venomous spiders."
610,2,1505,Myths,Medium,Bumblebees shouldn't be able to fly,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""bumblebees shouldn't be able to fly"" is based on a misunderstanding of aerodynamics. Early 20th-century calculations, using assumptions applicable to fixed-wing aircraft, suggested that bumblebee flight was impossible. However, bumblebees fly using different principles, such as rapid wing beats and creating vortices, which are well understood today. Therefore, the claim is definitely false."
611,2,1506,Myths,Medium,Glass is a slow-moving liquid,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that glass is a slow-moving liquid is a common misconception. Glass is actually an amorphous solid, meaning it lacks a long-range ordered crystal structure, but it is not a liquid. The idea that glass flows over time, such as in old windows, is not supported by scientific evidence. The variations in thickness of old glass panes are due to historical manufacturing processes, not the flow of glass."
612,2,1507,Historical,Medium,Medieval people thought Earth was flat,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that medieval people thought the Earth was flat is a misconception. By the Middle Ages, educated people in Europe widely accepted the idea of a spherical Earth, a concept that dates back to ancient Greek philosophers like Pythagoras and Aristotle. This understanding was maintained through the medieval period, as evidenced by scholarly works and educational curricula of the time. The myth of a flat Earth belief in the Middle Ages was popularized in the 19th century."
613,2,1508,Historical,Medium,Columbus proved Earth was round,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Columbus proved the Earth was round is definitely false. By the time of Columbus's voyages in the late 15th century, the spherical nature of the Earth was already well-established among educated Europeans. Ancient Greek philosophers like Pythagoras and later Aristotle had provided evidence for a round Earth, and this understanding was widely accepted in medieval Europe. Columbus's voyages did not prove the Earth was round; rather, they aimed to find a westward route to Asia."
614,2,1509,Scientific,Medium,Humans evolved from monkeys,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""humans evolved from monkeys"" is a common misconception. Humans and modern monkeys share a common ancestor, but humans did not directly evolve from monkeys. Instead, both humans and monkeys evolved separately from this common ancestor. The evolutionary tree shows that humans and monkeys are distinct branches that diverged millions of years ago. This understanding is well-supported by the scientific consensus in evolutionary biology."
615,2,1510,Scientific,Medium,Neanderthals were primitive,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Neanderthals were ""primitive"" is likely false when considering current scientific understanding. Neanderthals exhibited complex behaviors, such as creating tools, using fire, and possibly engaging in symbolic activities like art and burial practices. They had a similar brain size to modern humans and adapted to diverse environments. The term ""primitive"" is often misleading and does not accurately reflect their capabilities and cultural complexity."
616,2,1511,Scientific,Medium,Dinosaurs and humans coexisted,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that dinosaurs and humans coexisted is definitely false. Scientific evidence shows that non-avian dinosaurs went extinct approximately 66 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period, while anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens) did not appear until about 300,000 years ago. There is a significant gap of millions of years between the extinction of dinosaurs and the emergence of humans, making coexistence impossible."
617,2,1512,Scientific,Medium,T-Rex arms were useless,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that T-Rex arms were ""useless"" is likely false. While their arms were small relative to their body size, research suggests they may have had specific functions, such as holding prey, aiding in balance, or assisting in mating. The arms were muscular and had a range of motion, indicating they were not entirely without purpose."
618,2,1513,Scientific,Medium,All dinosaurs were reptiles,FALSE,TRUE,90.0%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Dinosaurs are traditionally classified as reptiles, as they belong to the clade Dinosauria, which is part of the larger group Reptilia. However, the classification of dinosaurs as reptiles is based on traditional taxonomy. Modern cladistics, which focuses on evolutionary relationships, places birds within the dinosaur clade, suggesting that not all dinosaurs fit the traditional characteristics of reptiles. Despite this, the claim is largely consistent with traditional scientific classification, hence it is likely true."
619,2,1514,Scientific,Medium,Pterodactyls were dinosaurs,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Pterodactyls were not dinosaurs; they were flying reptiles known as pterosaurs. While they lived during the same period as dinosaurs, they belong to a different group of reptiles. Dinosaurs are a distinct clade that includes creatures like the Tyrannosaurus rex and Triceratops, but not pterosaurs."
620,2,1515,Scientific,Medium,Dinosaurs were cold-blooded,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that dinosaurs were cold-blooded is uncertain. Traditionally, dinosaurs were thought to be cold-blooded like modern reptiles. However, recent research suggests that some dinosaurs may have been warm-blooded or had metabolic rates between cold-blooded and warm-blooded animals. Evidence from bone structure and isotopic analysis indicates a more complex picture of dinosaur metabolism, making it unclear to definitively categorize all dinosaurs as cold-blooded."
621,2,1516,Scientific,Medium,Asteroid killed all dinosaurs instantly,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that an asteroid killed all dinosaurs instantly is likely false. While a massive asteroid impact around 66 million years ago is widely believed to have caused the mass extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs, the process was not instantaneous. The impact would have led to a series of catastrophic environmental changes, including fires, a ""nuclear winter"" effect from debris blocking sunlight, and long-term climate shifts. These changes would have occurred over a period of time, leading to the gradual extinction of many species, including dinosaurs."
622,2,1517,Scientific,Medium,Neanderthals couldn't speak,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Recent research suggests that Neanderthals had the anatomical capability for speech, including a hyoid bone similar to modern humans and a complex vocal tract. Genetic studies have also shown that Neanderthals shared the FOXP2 gene associated with language in humans. While definitive evidence of their language use is lacking, the claim that they couldn't speak is likely false based on current scientific understanding."
623,2,1518,Historical,Medium,Cave people lived in caves,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The term ""cave people"" generally refers to prehistoric humans who are believed to have used caves as shelters. Archaeological evidence supports that some prehistoric humans did indeed live in caves, as evidenced by cave paintings and artifacts found in such locations. However, not all prehistoric humans lived in caves; many lived in other types of shelters. Therefore, while the claim is likely true for some groups, it is not universally applicable to all prehistoric humans."
624,2,1519,Historical,Medium,Vikings had horned helmets,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"There is no archaeological evidence to support the claim that Vikings wore horned helmets. This image is largely a product of 19th-century romanticism and popular culture, rather than historical fact. Viking helmets that have been discovered are typically simple and conical, without horns."
625,2,1520,Historical,Medium,Medieval armor was too heavy to move,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that medieval armor was too heavy to move is definitely false. Historical evidence and modern experiments demonstrate that medieval armor, while heavy, was designed to allow for mobility. Full suits of plate armor typically weighed between 45-55 pounds, which is comparable to the gear carried by modern soldiers. Knights were trained to fight, ride horses, and perform various movements while wearing armor. Therefore, the claim does not hold up against historical facts and practical demonstrations."
626,2,1521,Historical,Medium,Knights rescued damsels in distress,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The idea of knights rescuing damsels in distress is largely a romanticized notion popularized by medieval literature and later by Victorian and modern interpretations of chivalry. While there may have been instances where knights assisted women in danger, the concept is more myth than historical fact. The historical role of knights was primarily military, and the ""damsel in distress"" trope is more a product of storytelling than a reflection of common medieval practices."
627,2,1522,Historical,Medium,Witches were burned in Salem,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that witches were burned in Salem is definitely false. During the Salem witch trials of 1692, no accused witches were burned at the stake. Instead, 19 individuals were hanged, and one person was pressed to death with heavy stones. Burning was not a method of execution used in Salem."
628,2,1523,Historical,Medium,Iron maiden was medieval torture device,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The iron maiden is often depicted as a medieval torture device, but historical evidence suggests it was not used during the medieval period. The concept of the iron maiden appears to have been popularized in the 18th and 19th centuries, possibly as a myth or exaggeration of earlier torture methods. There is little to no credible evidence of its use in the Middle Ages, making the claim likely false."
629,2,1524,Historical,Medium,Chastity belts were used in Crusades,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,The idea that chastity belts were used during the Crusades is largely considered a myth. Historical evidence suggests that chastity belts as we imagine them today were not used during the medieval period. Most examples of chastity belts that exist today are from the 16th century or later and are often thought to be hoaxes or created for other purposes. The concept of chastity belts being used during the Crusades likely emerged from later romanticized or satirical accounts rather than historical fact.
630,2,1525,Historical,Medium,Napoleon was very short,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Napoleon was very short is likely false. Historical records indicate that Napoleon Bonaparte was around 5 feet 6 inches tall, which was average height for a Frenchman of his time. The misconception about his height may have arisen from differences in French and English measurement systems or from British propaganda."
631,2,1526,Historical,Medium,George Washington had wooden teeth,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that George Washington had wooden teeth is a common myth. Historical evidence shows that Washington's dentures were made from materials such as human teeth, animal teeth, ivory, and metal alloys, but not wood. The misconception may have arisen from the appearance of the materials used, which could have been stained and looked like wood."
632,2,1527,Historical,Medium,Benjamin Franklin discovered electricity,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Benjamin Franklin ""discovered"" electricity is misleading. Electricity was known to exist before Franklin's famous kite experiment in 1752. What Franklin did was demonstrate the electrical nature of lightning, contributing to the understanding of electricity. However, he did not discover electricity itself, as it was already being studied by others, such as William Gilbert and Stephen Gray, prior to Franklin's experiments."
633,2,1528,Historical,Medium,Einstein failed math,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Einstein failed math is a myth. Albert Einstein himself refuted this claim, stating that he had mastered differential and integral calculus before he was 15. Historical records and his academic performance indicate that he was proficient in mathematics from a young age."
634,2,1529,Historical,Medium,Nero fiddled while Rome burned,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""Nero fiddled while Rome burned"" is likely false. Historical evidence suggests that the fiddle did not exist during Nero's time; instead, he may have played the lyre. Additionally, contemporary accounts indicate that Nero was not in Rome when the fire started and that he took measures to aid the victims and rebuild the city. The phrase is often used metaphorically to suggest negligence or indifference, but it is not supported by historical facts."
635,2,1530,Historical,Medium,Marie Antoinette said 'Let them eat cake',FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Marie Antoinette said ""Let them eat cake"" is widely regarded by historians as likely false. There is no credible evidence that she ever uttered this phrase. It is believed to have been attributed to her as part of revolutionary propaganda to illustrate her supposed indifference to the plight of the poor. The phrase itself predates her and was found in writings by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who attributed it to an unnamed ""great princess."""
636,2,1531,Historical,Medium,Mussolini made trains run on time,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Mussolini made trains run on time is largely a myth. While Mussolini's regime did focus on improving infrastructure, including the railways, many of the improvements attributed to him were already underway before he came to power. Additionally, the Italian rail system still faced numerous issues during his rule. The claim is often seen as propaganda to bolster the image of efficiency under fascism."
637,2,1532,Historical,Medium,The pyramids were built by slaves,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Recent archaeological evidence suggests that the workers who built the pyramids were not slaves but rather paid laborers. Excavations have uncovered workers' villages, complete with evidence of food supplies and medical care, indicating that they were well-treated. This challenges the long-held belief that slaves built the pyramids, suggesting instead that a skilled workforce was employed for this monumental task."
638,2,1533,Historical,Medium,Cleopatra was Egyptian ethnically,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Cleopatra VII, the last active ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, was of Macedonian Greek descent. The Ptolemaic dynasty was established by Ptolemy I Soter, a companion of Alexander the Great, and they ruled Egypt after Alexander's conquest. While Cleopatra was born in Egypt and ruled as its queen, her ethnic background was primarily Greek, not Egyptian."
639,2,1534,Historical,Medium,Julius Caesar was born by C-section,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Julius Caesar was born by C-section is likely false. Historical evidence suggests that C-sections in ancient times were typically performed only when the mother was dead or dying, as the procedure was almost always fatal for the mother. Caesar's mother, Aurelia, is known to have survived his birth and lived for many years afterward, making it unlikely that he was delivered by C-section. The association of Caesar's name with the procedure is more likely a later myth or misunderstanding."
640,2,1535,Historical,Medium,Paul Revere shouted 'The British are coming',FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Historical evidence suggests that Paul Revere did not shout ""The British are coming"" during his famous midnight ride. Instead, he likely used a more discreet warning, such as ""The Regulars are coming out,"" to avoid alerting British patrols and because many colonists still considered themselves British. This phrase became popularized later through folklore and literature."
641,2,1536,Historical,Medium,Cowboys wore cowboy hats,FALSE,TRUE,90.0%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that cowboys wore cowboy hats is definitely true. Historical evidence and numerous accounts from the American West during the late 19th and early 20th centuries show that cowboy hats were a common and practical choice for cowboys. These hats provided protection from the sun and rain and were part of the iconic attire associated with cowboys. While not every cowboy may have worn a cowboy hat at all times, it was a prevalent and defining feature of their attire."
642,2,1537,Historical,Medium,Wild West had frequent shootouts,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The popular image of the Wild West as a place of frequent shootouts is largely a myth perpetuated by movies and folklore. Historical records indicate that while there were some famous gunfights, such as the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, they were not as common as often portrayed. Many towns had strict gun control laws, and most disputes were settled without violence. The perception of frequent shootouts is exaggerated compared to the historical reality."
643,2,1538,Historical,Medium,Pirates made people walk the plank,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The idea of pirates making people walk the plank is a popular trope in fiction, but historical evidence supporting this practice is scarce. While there are a few documented instances, they are rare and not representative of common pirate behavior. Most historical accounts suggest that pirates used more direct and brutal methods for dealing with captives."
644,2,1539,Historical,Medium,Pirates buried treasure,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The popular image of pirates burying treasure is largely a myth popularized by literature, such as Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Treasure Island."" Historical evidence suggests that pirates typically spent or traded their loot rather than burying it. While there may have been isolated incidents of treasure being buried, it was not a common practice among pirates."
645,2,1540,Historical,Medium,Vikings discovered America first,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Vikings discovered America first is likely true, as there is substantial evidence that Norse explorers, led by Leif Erikson, reached North America around the year 1000 AD, specifically landing in what is now Newfoundland, Canada. This is supported by archaeological findings at L'Anse aux Meadows. However, it's important to note that indigenous peoples had been living in the Americas for thousands of years before the Vikings arrived. The claim is true in the context of European discovery, but not in the absolute sense of being the first humans to discover America."
646,2,1541,Historical,Medium,Leif Erikson reached North America,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Historical evidence and Norse sagas, such as the Saga of the Greenlanders and the Saga of Erik the Red, suggest that Leif Erikson, a Norse explorer, reached North America around the year 1000 AD. Archaeological findings at L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland, Canada, support the presence of Norse settlers in North America, aligning with the time period of Erikson's voyages. While some details of the sagas are debated, the consensus among historians is that Leif Erikson did reach North America."
647,2,1542,Historical,Medium,"The Pinta, Nina, and Santa Maria were large ships",FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The Pinta, Nina, and Santa Maria were not considered large ships by the standards of their time. The Santa Maria, the largest of the three, was a medium-sized carrack, while the Pinta and Nina were smaller caravels. These ships were relatively small compared to other vessels used for long voyages in later centuries."
648,2,1543,Historical,Medium,Pocahontas saved John Smith,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Pocahontas saved John Smith is based on Smith's own account, which he wrote years after the event supposedly took place. Historians debate its accuracy, as Smith was known for embellishing stories, and there is no corroborating evidence from other sources. Additionally, some scholars suggest the event may have been a misunderstood ritual rather than a genuine rescue. Therefore, the truthfulness of the claim is uncertain."
649,2,1544,Historical,Medium,Pocahontas married John Smith,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Pocahontas married John Smith is definitely false. Historical records clearly indicate that Pocahontas married John Rolfe, not John Smith. John Smith was an English explorer who had interactions with Pocahontas, but there is no evidence of a marriage between them."
650,2,1545,Historical,Medium,Thanksgiving was always in November,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Thanksgiving has not always been in November. The first Thanksgiving in 1621, celebrated by the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag, did not have a fixed date and was not in November. The holiday was celebrated on various dates in different states until President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed a national Thanksgiving Day to be held in November in 1863. Prior to this, Thanksgiving was celebrated at different times, often in October or November, depending on the state or community."
651,2,1546,Historical,Medium,Pilgrims wore black and white,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The common image of Pilgrims wearing black and white clothing is largely a myth. Historical evidence suggests that Pilgrims wore a variety of colors, including reds, greens, browns, and blues. The black and white attire is more reflective of later Puritan fashion and was popularized by 19th-century artists and writers. Therefore, the claim is likely false, but not entirely without basis, as black and white clothing was worn on formal occasions."
652,2,1547,Historical,Medium,Pilgrims and Native Americans were friends,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The relationship between the Pilgrims and Native Americans was complex and varied over time. Initially, there were instances of cooperation and mutual assistance, such as the Pilgrims receiving help from the Wampanoag tribe, which included the famous 1621 harvest celebration often referred to as the ""First Thanksgiving."" However, this relationship was not uniformly friendly and deteriorated over time, leading to conflicts such as King Philip's War. The claim oversimplifies a nuanced historical relationship, making it unclear without additional context."
653,2,1548,Historical,Medium,Native Americans didn't use the wheel,FALSE,TRUE,90.0%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Native Americans didn't use the wheel is likely true in the context of pre-Columbian North and South America. While the wheel was known and used in some Mesoamerican cultures for toys, it was not widely adopted for practical purposes like transportation or machinery. This was largely due to the absence of large domesticated animals for pulling wheeled vehicles and the challenging terrain that made wheeled transport less practical."
654,2,1549,Historical,Medium,Columbus discovered tobacco,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Tobacco was already known and used by indigenous peoples in the Americas long before Columbus arrived. While Columbus and his crew were among the first Europeans to encounter tobacco, they did not ""discover"" it in the sense of being the first to find or use it. The claim is likely false because it overlooks the pre-existing knowledge and use of tobacco by native populations."
655,2,1550,Historical,Medium,Tomatoes were thought poisonous in Europe,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that tomatoes were thought to be poisonous in Europe is likely true. When tomatoes were introduced to Europe from the Americas in the 16th century, they were initially met with suspicion. This was partly because tomatoes are part of the nightshade family, which includes some toxic plants. Additionally, the acidic nature of tomatoes could cause lead to leach from pewter plates, leading to illness, which may have contributed to their reputation. However, this belief was not universal across Europe, and tomatoes eventually became a staple in European cuisine."
656,2,1551,Historical,Medium,Potatoes caused Irish famine,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""potatoes caused the Irish famine"" is misleading. The Irish Potato Famine, also known as the Great Famine, was primarily caused by a potato disease called late blight, which devastated the potato crop. However, the famine's severity was exacerbated by socio-economic factors, including British policies, land ownership issues, and reliance on a single crop. Therefore, while potatoes were involved, they were not the sole cause of the famine."
657,2,1552,Historical,Medium,Tea caused Boston Tea Party,TRUE,FALSE,90.0%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The Boston Tea Party was not caused by tea itself, but rather by the political and economic tensions surrounding British taxation policies, specifically the Tea Act of 1773. The act allowed the British East India Company to sell tea directly to the colonies, undermining colonial merchants and enforcing a tax that colonists had no say in. The event was a protest against taxation without representation, not the tea itself."
658,2,1553,Historical,Medium,Shot heard round the world was literal,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The phrase ""shot heard round the world"" is a metaphorical expression, not a literal one. It refers to the first shot of the American Revolutionary War at the Battles of Lexington and Concord in 1775, symbolizing the start of a significant global event. The shot was not literally heard around the world, but its impact was felt globally."
659,2,1554,Historical,Medium,Declaration signed on July 4th,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4th is likely false. While the Continental Congress adopted the Declaration on July 4, 1776, most delegates did not sign it until August 2, 1776. The misconception arises from the adoption date being celebrated as Independence Day."
660,2,1555,Historical,Medium,Liberty Bell cracked on July 4th,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The Liberty Bell did not crack on July 4th. Historical records indicate that the bell first cracked shortly after it arrived in Philadelphia in 1752. The most famous crack, which rendered it unringable, occurred in the early 19th century, likely during or after a tolling for George Washington's birthday in 1846. There is no evidence to support the claim that it cracked on July 4th."
661,2,1556,Historical,Medium,Betsy Ross designed the flag,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Betsy Ross designed the first American flag is largely considered a legend rather than a historical fact. The story gained popularity in the late 19th century, primarily due to the efforts of her grandson, William Canby, who presented it to the Historical Society of Pennsylvania in 1870. However, there is no contemporary evidence from the Revolutionary period to support this claim, and historians generally regard it as unlikely."
662,2,1557,Historical,Medium,Star Spangled Banner written during War of 1812,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim is definitely true. ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" was written by Francis Scott Key during the War of 1812. Specifically, Key wrote the lyrics in September 1814 after witnessing the bombardment of Fort McHenry by British forces."
663,2,1558,Historical,Medium,White House was always white,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The White House was not always white. Originally, the building was constructed with grayish sandstone. It was first painted white in 1798 to protect the porous stone from freezing and cracking during winter. Therefore, the claim that the White House was always white is likely false."
664,2,1559,Historical,Medium,Lincoln wrote Gettysburg Address on envelope,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Lincoln wrote the Gettysburg Address on an envelope is a popular myth. Historical evidence suggests that Lincoln prepared the speech in advance and not on the back of an envelope. Multiple drafts of the address exist, indicating that it was carefully composed. The myth likely arose from the romanticized idea of Lincoln hurriedly writing the speech on his way to Gettysburg."
665,2,1560,Historical,Medium,Lincoln freed all slaves with Emancipation,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The Emancipation Proclamation, issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863, declared the freedom of slaves in the Confederate states that were in rebellion against the Union. However, it did not apply to slave-holding border states that remained loyal to the Union or specific areas under Union control. Therefore, it did not free all slaves in the United States. The complete abolition of slavery was achieved with the ratification of the 13th Amendment in December 1865."
666,2,1561,Historical,Medium,Civil War was only about slavery,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the Civil War was ""only"" about slavery is likely false. While slavery was a central and primary cause of the Civil War, as evidenced by declarations of secession from Southern states and speeches by Confederate leaders, other factors also played significant roles. These include states' rights, economic differences between the industrial North and the agrarian South, and political power struggles. Therefore, while slavery was a critical issue, it was not the sole factor."
667,2,1562,Historical,Medium,Grant was a drunk,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Ulysses S. Grant, the 18th President of the United States and a prominent Union general during the Civil War, was often accused of being a heavy drinker. Historical accounts and personal testimonies from his contemporaries suggest that Grant did struggle with alcohol at various points in his life, particularly during periods of inactivity or stress. However, the extent of his drinking and its impact on his military and political career is debated among historians. While there is evidence to support the claim that Grant had issues with alcohol, labeling him simply as ""a drunk"" may oversimplify the complexities of his life and character."
668,2,1563,Historical,Medium,Lee owned slaves reluctantly,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Historical evidence suggests that Robert E. Lee, while reportedly expressing some personal discomfort with the institution of slavery, actively managed and enforced the labor of enslaved people inherited from his father-in-law's estate. Lee's actions, including his involvement in the capture and return of escaped slaves and his opposition to immediate emancipation, indicate that his ownership was not entirely reluctant. The claim lacks strong support from historical records, leading to a likely false rating."
669,2,1564,Historical,Medium,Reconstruction succeeded,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The success of Reconstruction is a complex and debated topic. Reconstruction, the period following the American Civil War, aimed to reintegrate Southern states into the Union and address the rights of freed slaves. It achieved some successes, such as the passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments, which abolished slavery and granted citizenship and voting rights to African Americans. However, it faced significant challenges, including resistance from Southern states, the rise of Jim Crow laws, and the eventual withdrawal of federal troops, which led to the disenfranchisement and segregation of African Americans. Thus, while it had some achievements, many of its goals were not fully realized, making the claim uncertain."
670,2,1565,Historical,Medium,Jim Crow laws were unofficial,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Jim Crow laws were official laws enacted by state and local governments in the United States, primarily in the Southern states, to enforce racial segregation and disenfranchise African Americans. These laws were legally sanctioned and enforced by government authorities, making the claim that they were ""unofficial"" definitely false."

If all cats are mammals and all mammals breathe, then it logically follows that all cats breathe. This is a valid deductive argument, and the premises are true based on biological classification."
672,2,1567,Logic_Reasoning,Hard,"Some doctors are rich, some rich are unhappy, so some doctors are unhappy",FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim uses logical reasoning that involves categorical syllogism, but it does not necessarily follow that the conclusion is true. The premises ""some doctors are rich"" and ""some rich are unhappy"" do not logically guarantee that ""some doctors are unhappy."" The conclusion could be true, but it is not definitively supported by the premises alone. Therefore, the claim is uncertain, and the reasoning is somewhat speculative."
673,2,1568,Logic_Reasoning,Hard,You're either with us or against us,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""You're either with us or against us"" presents a false dichotomy, suggesting only two possible positions when, in reality, there are often more nuanced stances available. People can be neutral, indifferent, or supportive of some aspects while opposing others. This oversimplification does not accurately reflect the complexity of most situations, making the claim likely false."
674,2,1569,Logic_Reasoning,Hard,My father has two sons and I have two brothers,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"If the speaker's father has two sons, one of them is the speaker. Therefore, the speaker can only have one brother, not two. The claim is likely false based on this logical inconsistency."
675,2,1570,Logic_Reasoning,Hard,"My sister has three brothers, I have two brothers",FALSE,TRUE,95.0%,NO,0.50,0.50,"If the speaker's sister has three brothers, and the speaker is one of those brothers, then the speaker would have two brothers.

676,2,1571,Logic_Reasoning,Hard,If A=B and B=C then A=C,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""If A=B and B=C then A=C"" is an application of the transitive property of equality, which is a fundamental principle in mathematics. This property states that if two values are each equal to a third value, then they are equal to each other. This is a well-established and universally accepted rule in mathematics, making the claim definitely true."
677,2,1572,Logic_Reasoning,Hard,"Successful people wake early, I wake early, so I'll succeed",FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim uses flawed logic by implying causation from correlation. While many successful people may wake early, waking early alone does not guarantee success. Success is influenced by numerous factors such as skills, opportunities, and perseverance. Therefore, the claim is likely false as it oversimplifies the path to success."

681,2,1576,Logic_Reasoning,Hard,More firefighters at fires cause more damage,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that more firefighters at fires cause more damage is likely false. The presence of more firefighters is typically a response to larger or more severe fires, which inherently cause more damage. The correlation between the number of firefighters and the extent of damage is not causal; rather, both are effects of the fire's severity. Therefore, the claim misunderstands the relationship between these variables."

Just because something has been done a certain way for a long time does not inherently make it correct or optimal.

Without context or evidence about the relationship between X and Y, it is unclear whether the claim is true or false. The outcome depends on various factors, including the nature of X and Y, existing evidence, and potential intervening variables. Therefore, the claim is uncertain, and the confidence in this assessment is low due to the lack of specific information."

It is based on empirical evidence and the scientific method, which are not applicable to all types of questions, particularly those involving subjective experiences, moral values, or metaphysical concepts. Therefore, while science can answer many questions about the physical universe, it cannot address every question, especially those outside its empirical scope."
759,2,1654,Controversial,Hard,Is progress inevitable?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""progress is inevitable"" is inherently uncertain because it depends on various factors, including technological, social, economic, and environmental conditions. While historical trends often show progress in certain areas, such as technology and medicine, there are also instances of regression or stagnation due to wars, economic downturns, or environmental challenges. The concept of progress itself is subjective and can vary based on cultural and individual perspectives. Therefore, the inevitability of progress cannot be definitively stated as true or false."
760,2,1655,Controversial,Hard,Do abstract objects exist?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The existence of abstract objects is a philosophical question rather than an empirical one. Abstract objects, such as numbers, properties, and concepts, are not physical entities and their existence is debated among philosophers. Some argue they exist as non-physical entities (Platonism), while others claim they are merely useful fictions (nominalism). Since this is a matter of philosophical interpretation rather than empirical fact, the claim remains uncertain."
761,2,1656,Controversial,Hard,Can we know anything for certain?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Can we know anything for certain?"" touches on philosophical debates about knowledge and certainty. In epistemology, some argue that certain knowledge is possible (e.g., mathematical truths), while others, like skeptics, argue that certainty is unattainable. The question remains open to interpretation and philosophical perspective, making it unclear whether absolute certainty is achievable."
762,2,1657,Controversial,Hard,Is solipsism refutable?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Solipsism, the philosophical idea that only one's own mind is sure to exist, is inherently difficult to refute because it questions the existence of anything outside one's own consciousness. Since any evidence or argument against solipsism would be perceived through the individual's own mind, it cannot be definitively proven or disproven. This makes the claim uncertain or unclear, as solipsism is more of a philosophical stance than a testable hypothesis."
763,2,1658,Controversial,Hard,Does the universe have a purpose?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Does the universe have a purpose?"" is inherently philosophical and subjective, lacking empirical evidence or a definitive scientific answer. Different philosophical, religious, and scientific perspectives offer varying interpretations, but none can be conclusively proven or disproven. Therefore, the claim remains uncertain and unclear, with moderate confidence in this assessment due to the nature of the question."
764,2,1659,Controversial,Hard,Is enlightenment achievable?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The concept of enlightenment is subjective and varies across different philosophical, spiritual, and religious traditions. In Buddhism, for example, enlightenment is considered achievable through practices like meditation and ethical living. However, in other contexts, it may be seen as an abstract or unattainable ideal. The lack of a universally accepted definition or criteria for enlightenment makes it difficult to definitively assess the claim's truthfulness."
765,2,1660,Controversial,Hard,Can evil be justified?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Can evil be justified?"" is inherently subjective and depends on moral, philosophical, and cultural perspectives. Different ethical frameworks (e.g., utilitarianism, deontology) may offer varying interpretations of what constitutes ""evil"" and whether it can be justified. Historical and situational contexts also influence this assessment. Therefore, the claim is uncertain and unclear, as it lacks a definitive answer universally accepted across all contexts."
766,2,1661,Controversial,Hard,Is revenge ever justified?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The justification of revenge is subjective and varies based on cultural, ethical, and individual perspectives. Some philosophical and legal systems argue against revenge, promoting justice and rehabilitation instead. Others may see it as a natural response to wrongdoing. The lack of a universally accepted standard makes the claim uncertain."
767,2,1662,Controversial,Hard,Should we value equality or freedom more?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim is a subjective question rather than a factual statement, as it involves personal values and philosophical perspectives. The prioritization of equality versus freedom depends on individual beliefs, cultural contexts, and specific situations. Therefore, it cannot be objectively rated as true or false."
768,2,1663,Controversial,Hard,Is patriotism a virtue?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""patriotism is a virtue"" is subjective and depends on individual perspectives and cultural contexts. Virtue is often defined as a trait or quality deemed to be morally good, and opinions on whether patriotism fits this definition vary widely. Some view patriotism as a positive expression of loyalty and love for one's country, while others see it as potentially leading to nationalism or exclusionary practices. Therefore, the truthfulness of the claim is uncertain and context-dependent."
769,2,1664,Controversial,Hard,Should art have moral limits?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Should art have moral limits?"" is a subjective question rather than a factual statement, making it inherently uncertain. The answer depends on individual perspectives, cultural contexts, and philosophical beliefs about the role of art in society. Some argue that art should challenge moral boundaries to provoke thought and discussion, while others believe it should adhere to certain ethical standards to prevent harm. Therefore, the claim cannot be definitively rated as true or false."
770,2,1665,Controversial,Hard,Is cultural relativism true?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Cultural relativism is a philosophical concept suggesting that moral and ethical systems are relative to culture and that no one system is superior to another. The truthfulness of cultural relativism is inherently subjective and depends on one's philosophical perspective. It is not an empirical claim that can be definitively proven or disproven, making it uncertain or unclear. The concept is widely debated, with arguments both for and against it, which supports a score of 0.5. My confidence in this assessment is relatively high due to the extensive philosophical discourse surrounding the topic."
771,2,1666,Controversial,Hard,Can we have knowledge without experience?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Can we have knowledge without experience?"" is a philosophical question that has been debated extensively. Some philosophical perspectives, like rationalism, argue that certain knowledge can be innate or derived through reason without direct experience. Conversely, empiricism posits that knowledge comes primarily from sensory experience. The truthfulness of the claim depends on the philosophical framework one subscribes to, making it inherently uncertain and subjective."
772,2,1667,Controversial,Hard,Is determinism compatible with free will?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The compatibility of determinism with free will is a longstanding philosophical debate with no definitive resolution. Compatibilists argue that free will can coexist with determinism, suggesting that free will is the ability to act according to one's motivations and desires, even if those are determined. In contrast, incompatibilists believe that if determinism is true, free will cannot exist because our actions would be predetermined. The claim's truthfulness depends on one's philosophical perspective, making it inherently uncertain."

The question of whether we should edit human embryos involves ethical, scientific, and societal considerations, which are subjective and debated. The scientific capability to edit human embryos exists, but whether it should be done is a matter of opinion and policy, not fact. Therefore, the claim is rated as uncertain/unclear."
778,2,1673,Controversial,Hard,Is inequality always bad?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""inequality is always bad"" is likely false because inequality can have both negative and positive aspects depending on the context. While economic and social inequalities can lead to negative outcomes like poverty and social unrest, some level of inequality can drive competition, innovation, and economic growth. Therefore, the impact of inequality is context-dependent, and it is not universally negative."
779,2,1674,Controversial,Hard,Can war ever be just?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Can war ever be just?"" is inherently subjective and philosophical, making it unclear and dependent on individual perspectives and ethical frameworks. The concept of a ""just war"" is debated in moral philosophy and international law, with some arguing that war can be justified under certain conditions (e.g., self-defense, protecting human rights), while others contend that war is inherently unjust. Therefore, the truthfulness of the claim cannot be definitively determined, leading to an uncertain rating."
780,2,1675,Controversial,Hard,Is censorship ever justified?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Is censorship ever justified?"" is subjective and context-dependent. Censorship can be justified in certain situations, such as to protect national security, prevent hate speech, or protect minors from harmful content. However, it can also be misused to suppress dissent and limit freedom of expression. The justification for censorship depends on the context and the balance between protecting societal interests and preserving individual freedoms."
781,2,1676,Controversial,Hard,Should we extend human lifespan?,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Should we extend human lifespan?"" is not a factual statement but rather a question that invites ethical, scientific, and philosophical debate. It does not have a truth value in the traditional sense, as it depends on subjective perspectives and values. The question involves considerations of potential benefits, such as increased knowledge and experience, as well as potential drawbacks, such as overpopulation and resource depletion. Therefore, it is uncertain/unclear, and the assessment is based on the nature of the question rather than empirical evidence."
782,2,1677,Scientific,Medium,DNA is shaped like a double helix,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that DNA is shaped like a double helix is definitely true. The double helix structure of DNA was first described by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, and it has been confirmed by numerous studies and is a fundamental concept in molecular biology. The double helix consists of two strands that coil around each other, forming the characteristic shape."
783,2,1678,Scientific,Medium,Cells are the basic unit of life,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""cells are the basic unit of life"" is a fundamental principle of biology, known as the cell theory. This theory states that all living organisms are composed of cells, and that the cell is the smallest unit of life that can perform all life processes. This concept is widely accepted and supported by extensive scientific evidence."
784,2,1679,Scientific,Medium,Mitochondria produce energy,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Mitochondria are known as the ""powerhouses"" of the cell because they produce energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through a process called oxidative phosphorylation.

785,2,1680,Scientific,Medium,Chloroplasts perform photosynthesis,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Chloroplasts are organelles found in plant cells and some algae that are responsible for conducting photosynthesis. They contain chlorophyll, which captures light energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This process is well-documented in biological sciences, making the claim definitely true."
786,2,1681,Scientific,Medium,Bacteria are single-celled organisms,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Bacteria are indeed single-celled organisms. They are classified as prokaryotes, which are unicellular organisms that lack a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. This is a well-established fact in microbiology."
787,2,1682,Scientific,Medium,Viruses are living organisms,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The classification of viruses as living organisms is a subject of debate among scientists. Viruses lack many characteristics of living organisms, such as the ability to reproduce independently and carry out metabolic processes. They require a host cell to replicate, which is why many scientists consider them to be non-living entities. However, they do contain genetic material and can evolve, which are traits of living organisms. Due to these conflicting characteristics, the claim is likely false, but not definitively so."
788,2,1683,Scientific,Medium,Antibiotics kill viruses,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Antibiotics are designed to target and kill bacteria, not viruses. They work by attacking the cell walls, protein synthesis, or DNA replication of bacteria, none of which are applicable to viruses. Viruses have a different structure and replication process, which antibiotics cannot affect. Therefore, the claim that antibiotics kill viruses is definitely false."
789,2,1684,Scientific,Medium,Vaccines contain dead viruses,FALSE,TRUE,90.0%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Some vaccines do contain dead (inactivated) viruses, such as the inactivated polio vaccine and some flu vaccines. However, not all vaccines use dead viruses; some use live attenuated viruses, viral proteins, or mRNA. Therefore, the claim is likely true for certain vaccines but not universally applicable to all vaccines."
790,2,1685,Scientific,Medium,Blood type O is universal donor,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that blood type O is a universal donor is mostly true but requires clarification. Specifically, blood type O negative (O-) is considered the universal donor for red blood cells because it lacks A, B, and Rh antigens, minimizing the risk of an immune reaction in recipients of any blood type. However, O positive (O+) blood can only be safely given to Rh-positive recipients. Therefore, while the claim is generally accurate, it is important to specify that it is O negative blood that is universally compatible."
791,2,1686,Scientific,Medium,Humans have 206 bones as adults,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that humans have 206 bones as adults is a well-established fact in human anatomy. While infants are born with approximately 270 bones, some of these bones fuse together as they grow, resulting in the standard count of 206 bones in a typical adult human skeleton. This information is consistently supported by anatomical textbooks and scientific literature."
792,2,1687,Scientific,Medium,The heart has four chambers,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,The claim that the heart has four chambers is definitely true. The human heart is anatomically composed of four chambers: two atria (the left atrium and the right atrium) and two ventricles (the left ventricle and the right ventricle). This is a well-established fact in human biology and anatomy.
793,2,1688,Scientific,Medium,The brain uses most of body's energy,FALSE,TRUE,90.0%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The brain, while only accounting for about 2% of body weight, uses approximately 20% of the body's energy, primarily in the form of glucose. This is a significant portion, but it is not the majority of the body's energy. Other organs and systems, such as muscles, also consume substantial amounts of energy, especially during physical activity. Therefore, while the brain is a major energy consumer, it does not use most of the body's energy."
794,2,1689,Scientific,Medium,Neurons can regenerate easily,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Traditionally, it was believed that neurons in the adult human brain do not regenerate. However, recent research has shown that certain areas of the brain, such as the hippocampus, can generate new neurons in a process called neurogenesis. Despite this, the overall ability of neurons to regenerate is limited and not ""easy"" compared to other cell types in the body. Therefore, the claim that neurons can regenerate easily is likely false."
795,2,1690,Scientific,Medium,The liver can regenerate,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The liver is well-documented in scientific literature as having the ability to regenerate. It can regrow to its original size even after up to 70% of it has been removed, as long as the remaining tissue is healthy. This regenerative capacity is a unique and well-established characteristic of the liver among human organs."
796,2,1691,Scientific,Medium,Kidneys filter blood,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that kidneys filter blood is definitely true. Kidneys are essential organs in the human body responsible for filtering waste products and excess substances from the blood, which are then excreted as urine. This function is well-documented in medical literature and is a fundamental aspect of human physiology."
797,2,1692,Scientific,Medium,The appendix is completely useless,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the appendix is completely useless is likely false. While historically considered vestigial, recent research suggests the appendix may play a role in gut health by housing beneficial bacteria and contributing to the immune system. However, it is not essential for survival, as people can live without it."
798,2,1693,Scientific,Medium,Tonsils serve no purpose,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Tonsils are part of the lymphatic system and play a role in the immune response by trapping pathogens that enter through the mouth and nose. While they can be removed if problematic, they do serve a purpose, especially in early childhood when the immune system is developing."
799,2,1694,Scientific,Medium,Wisdom teeth are vestigial,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Wisdom teeth are often considered vestigial because they are remnants of a time when human ancestors had larger jaws with more teeth to help chew a tougher diet. As human diets and jaw sizes evolved, the need for these extra molars diminished. Today, many people do not have enough space in their mouths for wisdom teeth, leading to impaction and other dental issues, which supports the idea that they are vestigial. However, they can still function as normal teeth if they erupt properly, which is why the claim is rated as likely true rather than definitely true."
800,2,1695,Scientific,Medium,Fingerprints are unique,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Fingerprints are generally considered unique to each individual, and this uniqueness is a foundational principle in forensic science for identification purposes. However, the claim that fingerprints are absolutely unique has not been scientifically proven with complete certainty, as it is theoretically possible, though extremely unlikely, for two individuals to have identical fingerprints. The lack of evidence for identical fingerprints in billions of people supports the claim's likelihood, but the absence of absolute proof means it cannot be rated as definitely true."
801,2,1696,Scientific,Medium,Identical twins have same DNA,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Identical twins originate from the same fertilized egg, which means they start with the same DNA. However, mutations can occur during cell division, leading to slight genetic differences. Additionally, epigenetic changes can cause differences in gene expression. While they have very similar DNA, they are not 100% identical at the genetic level."
802,2,1697,Scientific,Medium,Blood is red because of iron,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Blood is red primarily because of the presence of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that contains iron. The iron in hemoglobin binds with oxygen, and this oxygenated form of hemoglobin is what gives blood its red color. While iron itself is not red, its interaction with oxygen in hemoglobin is responsible for the red appearance of blood."
803,2,1698,Scientific,Medium,Veins carry blue blood,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that veins carry blue blood is definitely false. Human blood is always red due to the presence of hemoglobin, which is red when oxygenated and darker red when deoxygenated. Veins appear blue through the skin due to the way light penetrates the skin and is absorbed and scattered by the tissues and blood. This optical effect does not indicate that the blood itself is blue."
804,2,1699,Scientific,Medium,The tongue map is accurate,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The tongue map, which suggests that different parts of the tongue are responsible for tasting different flavors (sweet, salty, sour, bitter), has been debunked by modern research. Taste receptors for all flavors are distributed across the tongue, not confined to specific areas. This claim is likely false based on current scientific understanding."
805,2,1700,Scientific,Medium,Humans have only five senses,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that humans have only five senses is likely false. While the traditional view includes five senses (sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch), scientific understanding recognizes additional senses such as balance (vestibular sense), temperature (thermoception), pain (nociception), and body position (proprioception), among others. Therefore, the concept of only five senses is an oversimplification."
806,2,1701,Scientific,Medium,The skin is the largest organ,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the skin is the largest organ is widely accepted and supported by scientific evidence. The skin covers the entire body, has a surface area of about 1.5 to 2 square meters in adults, and serves multiple vital functions, including protection, regulation, and sensation. No other organ in the human body matches the skin in terms of size and surface area."
807,2,1702,Scientific,Medium,Hair and nails are alive,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Hair and nails are composed of keratin, a protein, and are not alive. The cells that produce hair and nails are alive, but the hair and nails themselves are not. Once the cells die, they form the hair and nail structures."
808,2,1703,Scientific,Medium,Goosebumps are vestigial,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Goosebumps are considered vestigial because they are a remnant of a physiological response that was more useful to our ancestors. In animals with fur, the contraction of tiny muscles at the base of hair follicles causes the fur to stand up, providing insulation or making the animal appear larger to predators. In humans, this response is largely redundant due to our lack of dense body hair, making goosebumps a vestigial reflex."
809,2,1704,Scientific,Medium,Hiccups serve no purpose,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The purpose of hiccups is not definitively understood, and there is no consensus among scientists about their function. Some theories suggest they may be a vestigial reflex or serve a developmental role in fetuses, but these are not conclusively proven. Therefore, the claim that hiccups serve no purpose is uncertain."
810,2,1705,Scientific,Medium,Yawning is contagious,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that yawning is contagious is supported by numerous studies suggesting that seeing, hearing, or even thinking about yawning can trigger yawns in others. This phenomenon is believed to be linked to social and empathetic behaviors in humans and some animals. However, the exact mechanisms and reasons for this contagion are not fully understood, which prevents a definitive rating of 1.0."
811,2,1706,Scientific,Medium,Stretching prevents injuries,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that stretching prevents injuries is widely believed, but scientific evidence is mixed. Some studies suggest that stretching can improve flexibility and range of motion, which might reduce the risk of certain injuries. However, other research indicates that stretching alone does not significantly prevent injuries, especially acute injuries. The effectiveness of stretching may depend on the type of activity, the individual, and how stretching is incorporated into a broader warm-up routine. Therefore, the claim remains uncertain and context-dependent."
812,2,1707,Scientific,Medium,Muscle turns to fat if you stop exercising,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Muscle and fat are two distinct types of tissue with different functions and structures. Muscle does not transform into fat if you stop exercising. Instead, if you reduce physical activity, muscle mass may decrease due to atrophy, and if calorie intake exceeds expenditure, fat may accumulate. However, these are separate processes, not a conversion of one tissue type into another."
813,2,1708,Scientific,Medium,Lactic acid causes muscle soreness,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that lactic acid causes muscle soreness is likely false. Current scientific understanding indicates that lactic acid is not responsible for muscle soreness, which is more accurately attributed to microscopic damage to muscle fibers and the resulting inflammation, known as delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Lactic acid is produced during intense exercise but is cleared from the muscles within an hour after exercise, whereas soreness typically peaks 24-72 hours later."
814,2,1709,Scientific,Medium,"No pain, no gain is true",FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The phrase ""No pain, no gain"" is often used to suggest that experiencing discomfort or hardship is necessary for achieving success or improvement, particularly in physical fitness. While some level of effort and discomfort can be part of growth and progress, the phrase is not universally true. Pain can sometimes indicate injury or harm, and not all gains require pain. The truth of the claim depends on context, making it uncertain or unclear overall."
815,2,1710,Scientific,Medium,Spot reduction of fat is possible,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that spot reduction of fat is possible is likely false. Scientific studies have consistently shown that spot reduction, or the idea that you can lose fat in a specific area of the body by exercising that part, is not effective. Fat loss tends to occur throughout the body based on overall caloric expenditure and genetic factors, rather than targeted exercise. While exercising a specific area can increase muscle tone, it does not specifically reduce fat in that area."
816,2,1711,Scientific,Medium,Metabolism slows drastically with age,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"While metabolism does tend to slow with age, the change is generally gradual rather than drastic. Research indicates that metabolic rate decreases slowly over time, particularly after age 60, due to factors like loss of muscle mass and hormonal changes. However, the term ""drastically"" is misleading, as the decline is not sudden or severe for most people. Therefore, the claim is likely false in its characterization of the change as drastic."
817,2,1712,Myths,Medium,Eating late causes weight gain,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that eating late causes weight gain is not definitively supported by scientific evidence. Weight gain is primarily determined by the balance between calories consumed and calories expended. Some studies suggest that eating late may be associated with weight gain due to factors like increased calorie intake or disrupted circadian rhythms, but these findings are not conclusive. Individual lifestyle and dietary habits play a significant role, making the claim uncertain."
818,2,1713,Myths,Medium,Breakfast is the most important meal,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""breakfast is the most important meal"" is widely debated. Some studies suggest that eating breakfast can improve concentration and metabolism, while others indicate that skipping breakfast does not necessarily have negative health effects. The importance of breakfast may vary based on individual health needs, lifestyle, and dietary habits. Therefore, the claim is uncertain and context-dependent."
819,2,1714,Scientific,Medium,Eating eggs raises cholesterol,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The relationship between egg consumption and cholesterol levels is complex. While eggs are high in dietary cholesterol, recent studies suggest that for most people, eating eggs does not significantly impact blood cholesterol levels or increase the risk of heart disease. However, individual responses can vary, and some people may experience a rise in cholesterol levels. The claim is uncertain because it depends on individual health factors and dietary context."
820,2,1715,Scientific,Medium,Fat makes you fat,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Fat makes you fat"" is an oversimplification. While dietary fat is calorie-dense, consuming fat does not directly lead to weight gain unless it results in a caloric surplus. Weight gain is primarily influenced by the balance between calories consumed and calories expended. Additionally, fats are essential for various bodily functions and can be part of a healthy diet. The type of fat consumed (e.g., saturated vs. unsaturated) and overall dietary patterns also play significant roles in health outcomes."
821,2,1716,Scientific,Medium,Carbs make you fat,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Carbs make you fat"" is likely false because weight gain is primarily a result of consuming more calories than the body expends, regardless of whether those calories come from carbohydrates, fats, or proteins. Carbohydrates themselves do not inherently cause weight gain; rather, it is the overconsumption of calories in general that leads to fat accumulation. Additionally, carbohydrates are an essential part of a balanced diet and provide necessary energy for bodily functions. The context of overall diet, lifestyle, and individual metabolism plays a significant role in weight management."
822,2,1717,Scientific,Medium,Protein builds muscle,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Protein is essential for muscle growth as it provides the amino acids necessary for muscle repair and growth. However, protein alone does not build muscle; resistance training and other factors like overall nutrition and rest are also crucial. Therefore, while protein is a key component in muscle building, it is not the sole factor."
823,2,1718,Scientific,Medium,Gluten is bad for everyone,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. It is harmful to individuals with celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, or wheat allergy. However, for the majority of the population without these conditions, gluten is not inherently bad and can be part of a healthy diet. The claim that gluten is bad for everyone is likely false, as it does not apply universally."
824,2,1719,Myths,Medium,Dairy causes mucus,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The belief that dairy causes mucus production is a common misconception. Scientific studies have generally not supported the idea that dairy increases mucus production in the respiratory system. Some people may feel a thicker saliva or coating in their mouth after consuming dairy, but this is not the same as increased mucus production. The perception of increased mucus is subjective and not supported by objective measures."
825,2,1720,Scientific,Medium,Sugar causes diabetes,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that sugar directly causes diabetes is likely false. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition unrelated to sugar intake. Type 2 diabetes is influenced by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors, including diet. While excessive sugar consumption can lead to obesity, which is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, sugar itself is not a direct cause. The relationship is more about overall dietary patterns and lifestyle rather than sugar alone."
826,2,1721,Myths,Medium,Coffee stunts growth,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that coffee stunts growth is largely considered a myth. There is no scientific evidence supporting the idea that coffee consumption affects growth in children or adults. Growth is primarily determined by genetics and nutrition, not by caffeine intake. While excessive caffeine consumption can have other health effects, such as affecting sleep or bone health, it does not directly impact growth."
827,2,1722,Scientific,Medium,Drinking water flushes toxins,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Drinking water supports the body's natural detoxification processes by aiding kidney function, which filters waste from the blood and excretes it in urine. While water itself doesn't ""flush"" toxins, it is essential for maintaining the body's ability to remove waste effectively. However, the claim can be misleading if interpreted as water alone being responsible for detoxification, as the body relies on multiple organs and systems for this process."
828,2,1723,Scientific,Medium,Activated charcoal detoxifies,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Activated charcoal is known to bind to certain toxins and chemicals in the stomach and intestines, which is why it is used in some medical settings for specific types of poisoning or overdose. However, the claim that it ""detoxifies"" in a general sense is misleading. There is little scientific evidence supporting the idea that activated charcoal can detoxify the body from everyday toxins or improve health when used in supplements or foods. The term ""detoxify"" is often used in marketing without clear scientific backing."
829,2,1724,Scientific,Medium,Cleanse diets work,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Cleanse diets, often marketed as detox diets, claim to remove toxins and promote weight loss. However, scientific evidence supporting these claims is limited. The body naturally detoxifies itself through the liver, kidneys, and other organs. While some people may experience short-term weight loss on cleanse diets, this is often due to calorie restriction and water loss rather than actual fat loss. Additionally, cleanse diets can sometimes lead to nutrient deficiencies and other health issues. Therefore, the claim that cleanse diets work as advertised is likely false."
830,2,1725,Scientific,Medium,Superfoods exist,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The term ""superfoods"" is often used in marketing to describe foods that are purported to have exceptional health benefits due to their nutrient density. While certain foods like blueberries, kale, and quinoa are indeed rich in nutrients, the scientific community does not officially recognize ""superfoods"" as a distinct category. The health benefits of these foods are real, but the term itself is more of a marketing label than a scientifically validated classification. Therefore, the existence of ""superfoods"" is uncertain as it depends on the context in which the term is used."
831,2,1726,Scientific,Medium,Alkaline diet changes body pH,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that an alkaline diet can change the body's pH is likely false. The human body tightly regulates its pH levels, particularly in the blood, through various mechanisms such as respiration and kidney function. While an alkaline diet can alter the pH of urine, it does not significantly affect the overall pH balance of the body. The body's pH is maintained within a narrow range, and diet alone is not sufficient to change it."
832,2,1727,Scientific,Medium,Coconut oil is healthy,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Coconut oil is a source of saturated fat, which has been associated with increased LDL cholesterol levels, potentially raising the risk of heart disease. However, it also contains medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which some studies suggest may have health benefits, such as aiding weight loss and improving metabolism. The health effects of coconut oil can vary based on individual health conditions and dietary context. Therefore, the claim that coconut oil is healthy is uncertain and context-dependent."
833,2,1728,Scientific,Medium,Apple cider vinegar aids weight loss,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Some studies suggest that apple cider vinegar may aid weight loss by promoting satiety and reducing blood sugar levels, which could lead to reduced calorie intake. However, the evidence is not robust, and the effect size is generally small. More comprehensive research is needed to confirm these findings. Therefore, while there is some support for the claim, it is not definitive."
834,2,1729,Scientific,Medium,Green tea boosts metabolism,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Several studies suggest that green tea can boost metabolism due to its caffeine content and catechins, particularly epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). These compounds are believed to increase energy expenditure and fat oxidation. However, the effect size is generally small and may vary among individuals. While the evidence supports the claim to some extent, it is not definitive or universally applicable, hence the score reflects a likelihood rather than certainty."
835,2,1730,Scientific,Medium,Probiotics cure gut problems,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"While probiotics can be beneficial for certain gut-related issues, such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome, they are not a cure-all for all gut problems. The effectiveness of probiotics can vary depending on the specific condition, the strain of probiotic, and the individual. Scientific evidence supports their use in some cases, but not universally as a cure. Therefore, the claim that probiotics cure gut problems is likely false."
836,2,1731,Scientific,Medium,Multivitamins are necessary,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that multivitamins are necessary is likely false for most people. A balanced diet typically provides all the essential nutrients needed for good health. Multivitamins may be beneficial for certain groups, such as pregnant women, the elderly, or those with specific dietary restrictions or deficiencies. However, for the general population, they are not considered necessary. This assessment is supported by research indicating that multivitamins do not significantly improve health outcomes for most people who consume a varied diet."
837,2,1732,Scientific,Medium,Creatine is a steroid,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Creatine is not a steroid. It is a naturally occurring compound found in muscle cells that helps produce energy during high-intensity exercise. Steroids, on the other hand, are synthetic substances that mimic the effects of male sex hormones like testosterone. The two are chemically and functionally distinct."
838,2,1733,Scientific,Medium,Protein powder is unhealthy,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Protein powder is not inherently unhealthy. It can be a convenient source of protein for those who need to increase their intake, such as athletes or individuals with specific dietary needs. However, the healthiness of protein powder can depend on factors like the presence of additives, the quality of the protein source, and individual dietary requirements. While excessive consumption or reliance on protein powder over whole foods might pose health risks, moderate use as part of a balanced diet is generally considered safe."
839,2,1734,Scientific,Medium,Soy feminizes men,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that soy feminizes men is largely based on the presence of phytoestrogens in soy, which are plant-derived compounds with estrogen-like activity. However, scientific studies have shown that normal consumption of soy does not significantly affect testosterone levels or estrogen levels in men. The effects of phytoestrogens from soy are much weaker than human estrogen, and typical dietary intake does not lead to feminization. The claim is likely false, but some uncertainty remains due to individual variations and extreme consumption scenarios."
840,2,1735,Scientific,Medium,MSG is neurotoxic,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that MSG (monosodium glutamate) is neurotoxic is likely false. Extensive scientific research has shown that MSG is generally recognized as safe by major health organizations, including the FDA and the European Food Safety Authority. While some studies have suggested potential neurotoxic effects at extremely high doses, these conditions are not reflective of typical dietary consumption. The majority of evidence does not support the idea that MSG is neurotoxic at levels commonly found in food."
841,2,1736,Scientific,Medium,Artificial sweeteners cause cancer,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that artificial sweeteners cause cancer is likely false based on current scientific evidence. Extensive research, including studies by the National Cancer Institute and the FDA, has not found conclusive evidence that artificial sweeteners approved for use in food cause cancer in humans. Some studies in the past suggested a potential link, but these were often based on animal studies with high doses not comparable to typical human consumption. Regulatory agencies continue to monitor and evaluate new data, but as of now, the consensus is that artificial sweeteners are safe for human consumption at approved levels."
842,2,1737,Scientific,Medium,Microwaves destroy nutrients,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that microwaves destroy nutrients is likely false. Cooking methods, including microwaving, can lead to some nutrient loss, but microwaving is generally effective at preserving nutrients due to shorter cooking times and reduced exposure to heat. Studies show that microwaving can retain more nutrients compared to other methods like boiling. The extent of nutrient loss depends on the type of food and the specific nutrient."
843,2,1738,Scientific,Medium,Raw food is more nutritious,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""raw food is more nutritious"" is not universally true. While some nutrients, like vitamin C and certain enzymes, can be more abundant in raw foods, cooking can enhance the bioavailability of other nutrients, such as lycopene in tomatoes and beta-carotene in carrots. The nutritional value of food can vary depending on the type of food and the method of preparation. Therefore, the claim is context-dependent and cannot be generalized across all foods."
844,2,1739,Scientific,Medium,Freezing destroys nutrients,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Freezing does not destroy nutrients; rather, it preserves them by slowing down the enzymatic processes that cause food spoilage. Some nutrients, like vitamin C, may degrade slightly during the freezing process, but the overall nutrient loss is minimal compared to other preservation methods like canning or drying. Therefore, the claim that freezing destroys nutrients is likely false."
845,2,1740,Scientific,Medium,Fresh is always better than frozen,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Fresh is always better than frozen"" is likely false because the quality of fresh versus frozen foods can vary depending on several factors. Nutritional content in frozen foods can be comparable to or even better than fresh foods, as freezing preserves nutrients that might degrade over time in fresh produce. Additionally, the freshness of ""fresh"" foods can be compromised during transportation and storage, whereas frozen foods are preserved at their peak ripeness. Therefore, the superiority of fresh over frozen is not universally true."
846,2,1741,Scientific,Medium,Organic food is pesticide-free,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that organic food is pesticide-free is likely false. Organic farming does allow the use of certain natural pesticides and some synthetic substances that are approved for organic production. While organic foods generally have lower pesticide residues compared to conventional foods, they are not completely free of pesticides."
847,2,1742,Scientific,Medium,GMOs are unnatural,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The term ""unnatural"" is subjective and depends on one's definition. Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are created through human intervention in a laboratory setting, which some may consider unnatural compared to traditional breeding methods. However, humans have been altering organisms for thousands of years through selective breeding, which is a natural process. The distinction between natural and unnatural is not clear-cut, making the claim uncertain."
848,2,1743,Scientific,Medium,Hormones in milk are dangerous,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that hormones in milk are dangerous is likely false. Milk naturally contains hormones, but the levels are generally considered safe for human consumption. Regulatory bodies like the FDA and EFSA have evaluated the safety of hormones in milk, including those from cows treated with recombinant bovine somatotropin (rBST), and have found no significant risk to human health. While some people may have concerns about hormone levels, scientific evidence does not support the claim that these hormones are dangerous at the levels present in milk."
849,2,1744,Scientific,Medium,Searing meat seals in juices,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that searing meat seals in juices is a common culinary myth. Scientific experiments have shown that searing does not prevent moisture loss; in fact, it can cause meat to lose more moisture compared to other cooking methods. Searing does, however, enhance flavor through the Maillard reaction, which is why it is a popular technique."
850,2,1745,Scientific,Medium,Alcohol kills brain cells,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that alcohol kills brain cells is largely a myth. Scientific research indicates that moderate alcohol consumption does not kill brain cells. However, excessive alcohol use can damage the brain in other ways, such as affecting neurotransmitter function and causing brain shrinkage over time. The idea that alcohol directly kills brain cells is an oversimplification and not supported by current scientific evidence."
851,2,1746,Scientific,Medium,Weed is harmless,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""weed is harmless"" is likely false. While cannabis has therapeutic benefits and is considered less harmful than many other substances, it is not without risks. Potential harms include impaired cognitive function, addiction, mental health issues like anxiety or psychosis, and negative effects on lung health when smoked. The impact can vary based on the individual's health, frequency of use, and age of first use. Therefore, while it may be less harmful than some substances, it is not entirely without risk."
852,2,1747,Scientific,Medium,Nicotine causes cancer,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Nicotine itself is not classified as a carcinogen and does not directly cause cancer. However, it is highly addictive and is a primary component of tobacco products, which contain many other harmful substances that are known to cause cancer. The association between nicotine and cancer is indirect, primarily due to its presence in tobacco products."
853,2,1748,Scientific,Medium,Vaping is completely safe,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""vaping is completely safe"" is likely false. While vaping is generally considered less harmful than smoking traditional cigarettes, it is not without risks. Studies have shown that vaping can have negative health effects, including respiratory and cardiovascular issues. Additionally, the long-term effects of vaping are not yet fully understood. Therefore, it is inaccurate to claim that vaping is completely safe."
854,2,1749,Scientific,Medium,Cannabis is not addictive,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Cannabis can be addictive for some individuals. The condition known as Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) is recognized by medical professionals and can lead to dependence. Studies indicate that about 9% of users may develop an addiction, with higher rates among those who start using in adolescence. While not everyone who uses cannabis becomes addicted, the potential for addiction exists, making the claim likely false."
855,2,1750,Scientific,Medium,Psychedelics are always dangerous,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""Psychedelics are always dangerous"" is likely false. While psychedelics can pose risks, especially when used irresponsibly or by individuals with certain mental health conditions, they are not inherently dangerous in all contexts. Research has shown that psychedelics can have therapeutic benefits when used in controlled settings under professional supervision. The risks associated with psychedelics often depend on factors such as dosage, setting, and individual health. Therefore, the blanket statement that they are ""always dangerous"" is not supported by evidence."
856,2,1751,Scientific,Medium,Caffeine is highly addictive,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Caffeine is considered to have addictive properties, as it can lead to physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, and irritability. However, it is generally not classified as ""highly addictive"" in the same way as substances like nicotine or opioids. The level of addiction can vary among individuals, and while many people consume caffeine regularly without significant issues, some may experience difficulty in reducing intake."
857,2,1752,Scientific,Medium,Energy drinks are more caffeinated than coffee,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The caffeine content in energy drinks and coffee can vary widely. On average, an 8-ounce cup of coffee contains about 80-100 mg of caffeine. Energy drinks typically contain between 70-200 mg of caffeine per 16-ounce can. While some energy drinks may have more caffeine than a standard cup of coffee, many do not. Therefore, the claim that energy drinks are more caffeinated than coffee is likely false when considering typical serving sizes and averages."
858,2,1753,Myths,Medium,Red Bull gives you wings,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Red Bull gives you wings"" is a marketing slogan and not meant to be taken literally. Red Bull is an energy drink that contains caffeine and other ingredients that may temporarily increase alertness and energy levels, but it does not give a person physical wings or the ability to fly. The claim is metaphorical, and there is no scientific basis for it being literally true."
859,2,1754,Scientific,Medium,Sports drinks are necessary for exercise,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Sports drinks are not necessary for most exercise routines, especially those of moderate intensity or short duration. They are designed to replenish electrolytes and provide carbohydrates for energy, which can be beneficial during prolonged, intense physical activities lasting over an hour. For typical exercise sessions, water is usually sufficient for hydration. The necessity of sports drinks depends on the duration, intensity, and individual needs of the exercise, making the claim likely false for general exercise scenarios."
860,2,1755,Scientific,Medium,Chocolate is toxic to humans,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Chocolate contains theobromine, which is toxic to many animals, but humans can metabolize it more efficiently. While consuming extremely large amounts of chocolate could potentially lead to theobromine poisoning in humans, typical consumption levels are not toxic. Therefore, the claim that chocolate is toxic to humans is likely false."
861,2,1756,Myths,Medium,Poinsettias are deadly poisonous,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that poinsettias are deadly poisonous is likely false. While poinsettias can cause mild irritation or discomfort if ingested, such as nausea or vomiting, they are not considered deadly. Extensive studies and reports, including those from poison control centers, indicate that poinsettias are not highly toxic to humans or pets. The myth of their deadliness is largely exaggerated."
862,2,1757,Myths,Medium,Swallowing watermelon seeds grows plants in stomach,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that swallowing watermelon seeds can cause plants to grow in the stomach is definitely false. The human stomach is an acidic environment that breaks down food, including seeds, preventing them from germinating. Additionally, for a seed to grow, it requires specific conditions such as soil, sunlight, and water, which are not present in the human digestive system."
863,2,1758,Scientific,Medium,Double-dipping spreads bacteria,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Studies, such as one conducted by Clemson University, have shown that double-dipping can transfer bacteria from a person's mouth to the dip. The act of dipping a chip or other food item into a communal dip, taking a bite, and then dipping again can introduce bacteria from the mouth into the dip, potentially spreading bacteria to others who consume it. While the extent of bacterial spread can vary based on factors like the type of dip and the amount of saliva transferred, the basic premise that double-dipping can spread bacteria is supported by scientific evidence."
864,2,1759,Scientific,Medium,Five-second rule is valid,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The ""five-second rule"" suggests that food dropped on the floor is safe to eat if picked up within five seconds. Scientific studies have shown that bacteria can transfer to food almost instantaneously upon contact with a contaminated surface, making the time factor largely irrelevant. While the amount of bacteria transferred can depend on the type of surface and food, the rule is not a reliable measure of safety."
865,2,1760,Scientific,Medium,Washing hands with antibacterial soap is better,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Studies have shown that washing hands with regular soap and water is generally as effective as using antibacterial soap for removing germs and preventing illness. The FDA has stated that there is no significant evidence that antibacterial soaps are more effective than plain soap and water. Additionally, overuse of antibacterial products can contribute to antibiotic resistance. Therefore, the claim that antibacterial soap is better is likely false."
866,2,1761,Scientific,Medium,Hand sanitizer is better than washing,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Hand sanitizer is effective at killing many types of germs, but it is not better than washing hands with soap and water in all situations. Soap and water are more effective at removing certain types of germs, dirt, and chemicals. Hand sanitizer is a good alternative when soap and water are not available, but it does not remove all types of germs or substances."
867,2,1762,Myths,Medium,You should feed a cold and starve a fever,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The saying ""feed a cold and starve a fever"" is an old adage with no scientific basis. Modern medical advice suggests maintaining proper nutrition and hydration regardless of whether one has a cold or a fever. Both conditions require energy and fluids to support the immune system. Therefore, the claim is likely false, and my confidence in this assessment is relatively high based on current medical understanding."
868,2,1763,Scientific,Medium,Vitamin C prevents colds,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that vitamin C prevents colds is likely false. Numerous studies have shown that vitamin C does not significantly reduce the incidence of colds in the general population. However, it may slightly reduce the duration and severity of cold symptoms. The evidence supporting vitamin C as a preventive measure is weak, leading to a low score for truthfulness."
869,2,1764,Scientific,Medium,Zinc prevents colds,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that zinc prevents colds is uncertain. Some studies suggest that zinc may reduce the duration and severity of cold symptoms if taken within 24 hours of onset, but evidence on its ability to prevent colds is less clear. The effectiveness can vary based on the form of zinc and dosage. Therefore, while zinc might have some benefits related to colds, the claim that it outright prevents them is not strongly supported by current evidence."
870,2,1765,Scientific,Medium,Chicken soup cures colds,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that chicken soup cures colds is likely false. While chicken soup may help alleviate some symptoms of a cold, such as congestion and sore throat, by providing warmth and hydration, there is no scientific evidence to support that it cures the underlying viral infection. The benefits are more related to symptom relief rather than a cure."
871,2,1766,Myths,Medium,"Feed a fever, starve a cold",FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The saying ""feed a fever, starve a cold"" is a traditional adage with no scientific basis. Medical experts generally recommend maintaining a balanced diet and staying hydrated when sick, regardless of whether one has a fever or a cold. Proper nutrition and hydration support the immune system in fighting off infections.

872,2,1767,Scientific,Medium,Green mucus means bacterial infection,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Green mucus is often associated with a bacterial infection, but it is not a definitive indicator. The color change can occur due to the presence of white blood cells and enzymes, which can also be present in viral infections or other non-bacterial causes. Therefore, while green mucus can sometimes indicate a bacterial infection, it is not a reliable diagnostic tool on its own."
873,2,1768,Myths,Medium,Going outside with wet hair causes colds,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Colds are caused by viruses, not by being cold or having wet hair. While being cold or having wet hair might make someone feel uncomfortable, it does not directly cause a viral infection. The common cold is primarily spread through contact with infected individuals or surfaces."
874,2,1769,Myths,Medium,Cold weather causes colds,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The common cold is caused by viruses, primarily rhinoviruses, not by cold weather itself. However, cold weather can contribute to conditions that facilitate the spread of these viruses, such as people spending more time indoors in close proximity. Therefore, while cold weather is associated with an increased incidence of colds, it is not the direct cause."
875,2,1770,Scientific,Medium,Flu shot gives you the flu,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the flu shot gives you the flu is definitely false. The flu vaccine is made from inactivated (killed) viruses or a single protein from the flu virus, which cannot cause the flu. Some people may experience mild side effects, such as soreness at the injection site or a low-grade fever, but these are not the flu. This misconception likely arises from the timing of flu-like symptoms coinciding with the vaccination period, but these symptoms are not caused by the vaccine itself."
876,2,1771,Scientific,Medium,Natural immunity is better than vaccine immunity,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""natural immunity is better than vaccine immunity"" is complex and context-dependent. Natural immunity, acquired through infection, can provide robust protection against reinfection for some diseases. However, it often comes with the risk of severe illness or complications. Vaccine-induced immunity is designed to provide protection without the risks associated with the disease itself. For some diseases, vaccines can offer more consistent and safer immunity. The effectiveness of natural versus vaccine immunity can vary based on the disease, the individual, and the specific vaccine. Therefore, the claim is uncertain and requires more context for a definitive assessment."
877,2,1772,Scientific,Medium,Herd immunity prevents disease spread,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Herd immunity occurs when a significant portion of a population becomes immune to a disease, either through vaccination or previous infections, reducing the likelihood of disease spread. This concept is well-supported by scientific evidence, as it can protect those who are not immune by lowering the overall amount of disease transmission. However, the effectiveness of herd immunity depends on factors such as the disease's contagiousness and the immunity level required to prevent spread. While it does not completely prevent disease spread, it significantly reduces it, making the claim likely true."
878,2,1773,Scientific,Medium,Masks don't work,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""masks don't work"" is likely false. Numerous studies and health organizations, including the CDC and WHO, have provided evidence that masks can reduce the transmission of respiratory viruses, including COVID-19. Masks are particularly effective in preventing the spread of droplets from infected individuals, which is a primary mode of transmission for many respiratory illnesses. While the effectiveness can vary based on mask type and usage, the general consensus in the scientific community supports the use of masks as a public health measure to reduce virus spread."
879,2,1774,Scientific,Medium,Social distancing prevents disease,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Social distancing is a public health measure designed to reduce the spread of infectious diseases, particularly those transmitted via respiratory droplets, such as COVID-19 and influenza. By maintaining physical distance between individuals, the likelihood of person-to-person transmission is reduced. Numerous studies and public health guidelines support the effectiveness of social distancing in decreasing the spread of infectious diseases, although it is not a foolproof method and is most effective when combined with other measures like mask-wearing and hand hygiene."
880,2,1775,Scientific,Medium,Quarantine stops outbreaks,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Quarantine is a public health practice used to prevent the spread of infectious diseases by isolating individuals who may have been exposed to a contagious pathogen. Historical and contemporary evidence shows that quarantine can be effective in controlling outbreaks by reducing transmission rates.

This expedited timeline was due to unprecedented global collaboration, significant funding, and prior research on related coronaviruses. While the development was faster than usual, the vaccines underwent rigorous testing in clinical trials to ensure safety and efficacy. Therefore, while the timeline was accelerated, the necessary steps for vaccine approval were followed, making the claim ""likely true"" in terms of the speed of development, but not in terms of compromising safety or efficacy."

425,3,2215,Scientific,Medium,Clouds are made of water vapor,TRUE,FALSE,90.0%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Clouds are primarily composed of tiny water droplets or ice crystals, not water vapor. Water vapor is the gaseous form of water, which is invisible. When water vapor in the atmosphere cools and condenses, it forms the liquid droplets or ice crystals that make up clouds. Therefore, the claim that clouds are made of water vapor is likely false."
426,3,2216,Scientific,Medium,Fog is a cloud at ground level,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Fog is indeed a cloud that forms at ground level. It consists of tiny water droplets suspended in the air, similar to clouds that form higher in the atmosphere. This definition is widely accepted in meteorology, making the claim definitely true."
427,3,2217,Scientific,Medium,Dew forms from condensation,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Dew forms from the process of condensation, which occurs when water vapor in the air cools and changes into liquid water droplets. This typically happens when the temperature of a surface drops to the dew point, causing moisture in the air to condense on that surface. This is a well-established scientific explanation for the formation of dew."
428,3,2218,Scientific,Medium,Frost is frozen dew,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Frost and dew are both forms of condensation, but they form under different conditions. Dew forms when water vapor condenses into liquid droplets on surfaces when the temperature is above freezing. Frost forms when water vapor sublimates directly into ice crystals on surfaces when the temperature is below freezing. Therefore, frost is not simply frozen dew; they are distinct processes."
429,3,2219,Scientific,Medium,The moon causes ocean tides,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the moon causes ocean tides is well-supported by scientific evidence.

434,3,2224,Factual_Easy,Easy,Mars is called the Red Planet,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Mars is commonly known as the ""Red Planet"" due to its reddish appearance, which is visible even from Earth. This coloration is primarily due to iron oxide, or rust, on its surface. The nickname is widely recognized and used in both scientific and popular contexts."
435,3,2225,Scientific,Medium,Venus is the hottest planet,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Venus is indeed the hottest planet in our solar system. Despite Mercury being closer to the Sun, Venus has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, which creates a strong greenhouse effect, trapping heat and raising surface temperatures to an average of about 467 degrees Celsius (872 degrees Fahrenheit). This makes Venus hotter than Mercury, whose lack of a significant atmosphere allows heat to escape."
436,3,2226,Factual_Easy,Easy,Mercury is closest to the sun,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Mercury is the innermost planet in our solar system, orbiting closest to the Sun. This is a well-established fact in astronomy, supported by extensive observational data and scientific consensus."
437,3,2227,Factual_Easy,Easy,Neptune is the farthest planet,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Neptune is generally considered the farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system since Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006. However, Pluto's orbit is highly elliptical, and there are times when it is closer to the Sun than Neptune. Since Pluto is not classified as a planet, Neptune is the farthest recognized planet, making the claim likely true."
438,3,2228,Factual_Easy,Easy,Pluto is still classified as a planet,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) redefined the criteria for what constitutes a planet. Pluto did not meet these new criteria and was reclassified as a ""dwarf planet."" This classification has not changed since then, making the claim that Pluto is still classified as a planet definitely false."

442,3,2232,Factual_Easy,Easy,Comets have tails,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Comets are known to develop tails when they approach the Sun. The heat from the Sun causes the comet's ice to vaporize and release gas and dust, forming a glowing tail that points away from the Sun due to solar wind and radiation pressure. This phenomenon is well-documented and widely accepted in astronomy."
443,3,2233,Factual_Easy,Easy,Meteors are shooting stars,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""meteors are shooting stars"" is definitely true. In common parlance, a ""shooting star"" refers to the visible streak of light produced when a meteoroid enters the Earth's atmosphere and burns up due to friction with the air. This phenomenon is scientifically known as a meteor. Therefore, the terms ""meteor"" and ""shooting star"" are used interchangeably to describe the same event."
444,3,2234,Factual_Easy,Easy,The Milky Way is our galaxy,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""The Milky Way is our galaxy"" is definitely true. The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our solar system, including Earth. This is a well-established fact in astronomy, supported by extensive scientific evidence and consensus."
445,3,2235,Scientific,Medium,Black holes emit light,FALSE,TRUE,90.0%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Black holes themselves do not emit light in the traditional sense, as their gravitational pull is so strong that not even light can escape from within the event horizon. However, the concept of Hawking radiation, a theoretical prediction by physicist Stephen Hawking, suggests that black holes can emit radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This radiation can be considered a form of light emission. While Hawking radiation has not been observed directly, it is widely accepted in the scientific community as a plausible phenomenon. Therefore, the claim is likely true in the context of Hawking radiation."
446,3,2236,Scientific,Medium,The Big Bang created the universe,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model explaining the observable universe's early development. It posits that the universe expanded from a hot, dense state approximately 13.8 billion years ago. While it describes the universe's evolution from an early state, it does not explain the ultimate origin of the universe or what preceded the Big Bang. Therefore, the claim is likely true in the context of the universe's development from an early state, but not in terms of the absolute creation of the universe."
447,3,2237,Scientific,Medium,The universe is expanding,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the universe is expanding is well-supported by a substantial body of scientific evidence. Observations of distant galaxies show a redshift in their light, which is interpreted as a sign that these galaxies are moving away from us. This phenomenon was first observed by Edwin Hubble in the 1920s and has been consistently confirmed by subsequent observations and studies. The expansion of the universe is a cornerstone of modern cosmology and is supported by the Big Bang theory, which is the prevailing cosmological model explaining the early development of the universe."
448,3,2238,Scientific,Medium,Stars are made mostly of hydrogen,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Stars, including our Sun, are primarily composed of hydrogen. During the process of nuclear fusion in a star's core, hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium, releasing energy. This process is fundamental to a star's lifecycle and composition. The claim is consistent with well-established astrophysical knowledge."
449,3,2239,Scientific,Medium,The sun will become a black hole,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The sun does not have enough mass to become a black hole. Instead, it will eventually become a red giant and then shed its outer layers, leaving behind a white dwarf. Only stars with significantly more mass than the sun can collapse into black holes."
450,3,2240,Scientific,Medium,Supernovas create heavy elements,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Supernovas are known to create heavy elements. During a supernova explosion, the intense heat and pressure allow for nuclear reactions that produce elements heavier than iron. This process, known as nucleosynthesis, is well-documented in astrophysics and is a key mechanism for the formation of many heavy elements found in the universe."
451,3,2241,Scientific,Medium,Neutron stars are incredibly dense,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Neutron stars are known to be incredibly dense, as they are the remnants of massive stars that have undergone supernova explosions. The core collapses under gravity, causing protons and electrons to combine into neutrons, resulting in a star with a mass comparable to the Sun but compressed into a sphere with a radius of about 10 kilometers. This makes neutron stars one of the densest forms of matter in the universe, with densities reaching up to several times that of an atomic nucleus. This claim is well-supported by astrophysical observations and theoretical models."
452,3,2242,Scientific,Medium,Light years measure time,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"A light year is a unit of distance, not time. It measures how far light travels in one year, which is approximately 5.88 trillion miles (9.46 trillion kilometers). The term ""light year"" can be misleading because it includes the word ""year,"" but it is fundamentally a measure of distance in space."
453,3,2243,Scientific,Medium,Parsecs measure distance,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"A parsec is a unit of distance used in astronomy to measure large distances to astronomical objects outside the Solar System. It is equivalent to about 3.26 light-years. The term ""parsec"" is derived from ""parallax of one arcsecond,"" which is a method of measuring distances based on the apparent shift in position of a nearby star against the background of more distant stars as observed from Earth. Therefore, the claim that parsecs measure distance is definitely true."
454,3,2244,Factual_Easy,Easy,The closest star to Earth is Proxima Centauri,FALSE,TRUE,90.0%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim is likely true when considering stars outside our solar system. Proxima Centauri is the closest known star to the Sun, located about 4.24 light-years away. However, the Sun is technically the closest star to Earth. The claim is often interpreted in the context of stars beyond our solar system, which makes it likely true."
455,3,2245,Factual_Easy,Easy,The sun is the closest star to Earth,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,The sun is indeed the closest star to Earth. It is the center of our solar system and is approximately 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) away from Earth. This is a well-established scientific fact.
456,3,2246,Scientific,Medium,Constellations are actual star groupings,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Constellations are not actual star groupings in the sense of being physically related or gravitationally bound. They are patterns of stars as seen from Earth, often with stars that are not close to each other in space. The stars in a constellation can be at vastly different distances from Earth and are not necessarily related in any physical way."
457,3,2247,Factual_Easy,Easy,The North Star is the brightest star,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The North Star, also known as Polaris, is not the brightest star in the night sky. The brightest star is Sirius, which is part of the constellation Canis Major. Polaris is notable for its position nearly aligned with the Earth's rotational axis, making it a useful navigation star, but it is not the brightest."
458,3,2248,Factual_Easy,Easy,Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Sirius is indeed the brightest star in the night sky when observed from Earth. It is part of the constellation Canis Major and is often referred to as the ""Dog Star."" Its brightness is due to both its intrinsic luminosity and its relative proximity to Earth, being only about 8.6 light-years away. This claim is well-supported by astronomical observations and data."
459,3,2249,Factual_Easy,Easy,The moon has its own light,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The moon does not have its own light. It shines because its surface reflects sunlight. This is a well-established scientific fact, and there is no evidence to suggest that the moon emits its own light."
460,3,2250,Factual_Easy,Easy,Solar eclipses occur when the moon blocks the sun,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim is accurate. A solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between the Earth and the sun, blocking all or part of the sun's light from reaching Earth. This is a well-documented astronomical phenomenon."

This armistice marked the cessation of hostilities on the Western Front and is widely recognized as the end of World War I."
462,3,2252,Historical,Medium,The Cold War was a military conflict,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The Cold War is generally characterized as a period of geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies, rather than a direct military conflict. It involved political, economic, and ideological struggles, as well as proxy wars, but not direct military engagement between the two superpowers. Therefore, describing it as a ""military conflict"" is misleading."
463,3,2253,Historical,Medium,The Berlin Wall fell in 1989,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The Berlin Wall fell on November 9, 1989.

This period marked a revival of interest in the classical art, literature, and learning of Ancient Greece and Rome, and it eventually spread throughout Europe. The claim is well-supported by historical evidence and scholarly consensus."
466,3,2256,Historical,Medium,The printing press was invented in China,FALSE,TRUE,90.0%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the printing press was invented in China is likely true, as the earliest known form of printing, woodblock printing, originated in China around the 7th century. Additionally, movable type printing was developed by Bi Sheng in China during the 11th century. However, the specific invention of the mechanical movable type printing press, which revolutionized printing in Europe, is attributed to Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century. Therefore, while China did invent early forms of printing, the claim requires context regarding the type of printing press being referred to."
467,3,2257,Historical,Medium,Gutenberg invented the printing press,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Johannes Gutenberg is widely credited with inventing the movable-type printing press in Europe around 1440. While printing technology existed in Asia prior to Gutenberg, his development of the movable-type press significantly advanced the spread of printed materials in Europe. Therefore, the claim is likely true, but it is important to acknowledge earlier printing technologies elsewhere."

470,3,2260,Historical,Medium,Henry Ford invented the automobile,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Henry Ford invented the automobile is definitely false. The invention of the automobile is credited to Karl Benz, who built the first true automobile powered by an internal combustion engine in 1885-1886. Henry Ford is known for revolutionizing the automobile industry by developing assembly line production techniques, which made cars more affordable and accessible, but he did not invent the automobile itself."
471,3,2261,Historical,Medium,The telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Alexander Graham Bell is widely credited with inventing the first practical telephone and was awarded the first US patent for it in 1876. However, there were other inventors, such as Elisha Gray and Antonio Meucci, who also worked on similar technologies around the same time. Meucci's work, in particular, has been recognized posthumously by the US Congress. Despite these competing claims, Bell's patent and subsequent commercial success have led to his recognition as the inventor of the telephone."
472,3,2262,Historical,Medium,The light bulb was invented by Thomas Edison,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"While Thomas Edison is often credited with inventing the light bulb, he was not the first to create a light bulb. Several inventors, including Humphry Davy, Warren de la Rue, and Joseph Swan, developed earlier versions. Edison's contribution was significant in improving the design and making it commercially viable. Therefore, the claim is likely false, but Edison's role in the development of the practical light bulb is notable."

482,3,2272,Historical,Medium,The Roman Empire fell in 476 AD,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the Roman Empire fell in 476 AD is likely true, as this date marks the deposition of the last Roman emperor of the Western Roman Empire, Romulus Augustulus, by the Germanic chieftain Odoacer. This event is commonly cited by historians as the end of the Western Roman Empire. However, the Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire, continued to exist for nearly another thousand years until 1453. Therefore, while the claim is accurate regarding the Western Roman Empire, it does not account for the continuation of the Eastern Roman Empire."
483,3,2273,Historical,Medium,The Byzantine Empire was the eastern Roman Empire,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the Byzantine Empire was the eastern Roman Empire is historically accurate.

This rebranding was part of a strategic shift to focus on building the metaverse, a virtual reality space. The social media platform itself retained the name Facebook, but the parent company's name was changed to Meta. This information is well-documented and widely reported in credible news sources."
574,3,2364,Current_Events,Easy,TikTok became the most downloaded app,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"TikTok has been reported as the most downloaded app in various quarters and years, particularly in 2020 and 2021, according to multiple sources such as Sensor Tower and App Annie. However, app download rankings can fluctuate frequently, and the claim may not hold true for every specific time period. Therefore, while it is likely true for certain periods, it may not be universally true at all times."
575,3,2365,Current_Events,Easy,The metaverse became a tech buzzword,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The term ""metaverse"" has indeed become a tech buzzword, especially following Facebook's rebranding to Meta in 2021 and the increased interest in virtual and augmented reality technologies. The concept has been widely discussed in tech circles, media, and among companies exploring digital spaces."
576,3,2366,Current_Events,Easy,NFTs became popular in 2021,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) indeed gained significant popularity in 2021, with a surge in media coverage, public interest, and market activity. High-profile sales, such as Beeple's digital artwork selling for $69 million, and the involvement of celebrities and major brands contributed to their widespread recognition. While NFTs existed before 2021, this year marked a notable peak in their popularity."
577,3,2367,Current_Events,Easy,Cryptocurrency crashed in 2022,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"In 2022, the cryptocurrency market experienced significant downturns, with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum losing substantial value. The collapse of Terra's stablecoin and the bankruptcy of major crypto firms like FTX contributed to the market's decline. These events are widely reported and documented, supporting the claim that cryptocurrency crashed in 2022."
578,3,2368,Current_Events,Easy,AI image generation became mainstream in 2022,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"AI image generation tools, such as DALL-E 2, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion, gained significant attention and usage in 2022, with widespread media coverage and increased public interest. These tools became more accessible to the general public, contributing to their mainstream adoption. However, the term ""mainstream"" can be subjective, and while these tools were popular among certain groups, they may not have been universally recognized or used by everyone."
579,3,2369,Current_Events,Easy,Climate protests increased globally,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"There has been a noticeable increase in climate protests globally, particularly since the late 2010s, driven by movements like Fridays for Future and Extinction Rebellion. These movements have gained significant media attention and participation worldwide. However, the frequency and scale of protests can vary by region and over time, making it challenging to quantify the increase precisely. Nonetheless, the overall trend suggests a likely increase in climate protests."
580,3,2370,Scientific,Medium,Lightning never strikes twice in the same place,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Lightning never strikes twice in the same place"" is a common myth. In reality, lightning can and often does strike the same place multiple times, especially in areas with tall structures or conductive materials. For example, the Empire State Building in New York City is struck by lightning numerous times each year. Therefore, the claim is definitely false."
581,3,2371,Myths,Medium,You lose most body heat through your head,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that you lose most body heat through your head is likely false. This misconception originated from a flawed military study in the 1950s. Heat loss is generally proportional to the surface area exposed, and the head is not a significant proportion of the body's surface area. If the head is uncovered while the rest of the body is insulated, it may seem like more heat is lost through the head, but this is not inherently true for the body overall."
582,3,2372,Myths,Medium,Cracking knuckles causes arthritis,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Multiple studies have investigated the relationship between knuckle cracking and arthritis, and the consensus in the medical community is that there is no direct link between the two. The sound of cracking knuckles is caused by the formation of gas bubbles in the synovial fluid, not by damage to the joints. While habitual knuckle cracking may lead to other issues such as reduced grip strength or hand swelling, it does not cause arthritis."
583,3,2373,Myths,Medium,Swallowed gum stays in stomach for 7 years,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that swallowed gum stays in the stomach for 7 years is a myth. While gum is not easily digested, it does not remain in the stomach for an extended period. The human digestive system is capable of moving gum through the intestines and excreting it in a normal timeframe, typically within a few days. This claim has been debunked by medical professionals and lacks scientific evidence."
584,3,2374,Scientific,Medium,We only use 10% of our brains,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""we only use 10% of our brains"" is a myth. Neuroscientific research has shown that we use virtually all parts of our brain, and most of the brain is active almost all the time. Brain imaging technologies, such as fMRI and PET scans, demonstrate that even simple tasks require activity across multiple areas of the brain. This myth likely originated from a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of neurological research."
585,3,2375,Myths,Medium,Sugar makes kids hyperactive,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Numerous scientific studies have investigated the claim that sugar causes hyperactivity in children, and the majority have found no significant link. The belief that sugar makes kids hyperactive is largely based on anecdotal evidence and cultural myths rather than scientific data. Controlled studies, including those with placebo controls, have consistently shown that sugar does not affect children's behavior or cognitive performance. Therefore, the claim is likely false, and my confidence in this assessment is high."
586,3,2376,Myths,Medium,Carrots improve your night vision,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that carrots improve night vision is largely a myth. Carrots are rich in beta-carotene, which the body converts into vitamin A, an essential nutrient for maintaining healthy vision. However, while vitamin A is crucial for overall eye health and can prevent night blindness caused by a deficiency, eating more carrots than necessary for adequate vitamin A intake does not enhance night vision beyond normal levels. The myth was popularized during World War II as part of a British propaganda campaign."
587,3,2377,Myths,Medium,Reading in dim light damages eyes,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that reading in dim light damages eyes is likely false. While reading in low light can cause eye strain and temporary discomfort, there is no scientific evidence to suggest it causes permanent damage to the eyes. The discomfort typically resolves once normal lighting conditions are restored."
588,3,2378,Myths,Medium,Shaving makes hair grow back thicker,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that shaving makes hair grow back thicker is a common myth. Scientific studies have shown that shaving does not change the thickness, color, or rate of hair growth. When hair is shaved, it is cut at the surface, leaving a blunt tip. As the hair grows out, this blunt tip can feel coarser or appear darker, but the actual structure and growth rate of the hair remain unchanged."
589,3,2379,Myths,Medium,You need 8 glasses of water daily,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that you need 8 glasses of water daily is a common guideline but not a scientifically established requirement. Individual water needs vary based on factors like age, sex, weight, climate, and physical activity. The ""8x8"" rule (eight 8-ounce glasses) is a general recommendation, but many people get adequate hydration from other beverages and food. Therefore, while it can be a useful guideline for some, it is not universally necessary."
590,3,2380,Scientific,Medium,Microwaves cause cancer,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Microwaves use non-ionizing radiation, which does not have enough energy to remove tightly bound electrons or cause cellular damage that can lead to cancer. The primary effect of microwaves is to heat water molecules in food, not to alter DNA. There is no substantial scientific evidence linking microwave use to cancer."
591,3,2381,Scientific,Medium,Vaccines cause autism,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Extensive scientific research has consistently shown no causal link between vaccines and autism. The claim originated from a discredited study by Andrew Wakefield, which has been retracted due to methodological flaws and ethical issues. Numerous studies involving large populations have found no evidence supporting the claim that vaccines cause autism. Major health organizations, including the CDC, WHO, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, affirm that vaccines are safe and do not cause autism. Multiple sources refute this claim."
592,3,2382,Scientific,Medium,Organic food is more nutritious,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that organic food is more nutritious is debated and not definitively proven. Some studies suggest slight nutritional benefits in organic produce, such as higher antioxidant levels, but these differences are not consistently significant across all studies. The nutritional content of food can be influenced by many factors, including soil quality, farming practices, and food variety, making it difficult to generalize. Therefore, the claim remains uncertain and context-dependent."
593,3,2383,Scientific,Medium,GMOs are dangerous,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that GMOs are inherently dangerous is likely false. Numerous scientific studies and reviews by reputable organizations, such as the National Academy of Sciences, the World Health Organization, and the American Medical Association, have found that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) currently on the market are as safe to eat as their non-GMO counterparts. While there are concerns about environmental impacts and corporate practices, the consensus in the scientific community is that GMOs themselves do not pose a greater risk to human health than conventional foods."
594,3,2384,Scientific,Medium,MSG is harmful,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that MSG (monosodium glutamate) is harmful is likely false. Extensive scientific research has shown that MSG is generally recognized as safe by major health organizations, including the FDA and WHO, when consumed in typical amounts found in food. While some individuals may experience mild and temporary symptoms like headaches or flushing, these reactions are not common and are not considered harmful. The notion of ""Chinese Restaurant Syndrome"" has been largely debunked. Therefore, the claim lacks strong scientific support."
595,3,2385,Scientific,Medium,Detox diets cleanse toxins,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that detox diets cleanse toxins is likely false. The human body is naturally equipped with organs such as the liver, kidneys, and lungs that effectively remove toxins without the need for special diets. Scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of detox diets is limited, and many health professionals consider them unnecessary and potentially harmful. Detox diets often lack a clear definition of what ""toxins"" they target, and there is little evidence to suggest they provide any health benefits beyond those achieved by a balanced diet."
596,3,2386,Scientific,Medium,Alkaline water is healthier,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that alkaline water is healthier lacks strong scientific evidence. While some proponents suggest it can neutralize acid in the bloodstream, improve metabolism, and increase energy, these claims are not well-supported by rigorous scientific studies. The human body maintains a stable pH balance naturally, and there is little evidence that alkaline water provides significant health benefits over regular water. Therefore, the claim is likely false, but not definitively so, due to the lack of comprehensive research."
597,3,2387,Scientific,Medium,Antioxidants prevent cancer,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that antioxidants prevent cancer is uncertain. While antioxidants can neutralize free radicals and reduce oxidative stress, which is linked to cancer development, scientific studies have shown mixed results. Some research suggests potential benefits, while other studies indicate no significant effect or even potential harm in high doses. Therefore, the evidence does not conclusively support the claim that antioxidants prevent cancer."
598,3,2388,Scientific,Medium,Vitamin C prevents colds,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that vitamin C prevents colds is likely false. Numerous studies have shown that vitamin C does not significantly reduce the incidence of colds in the general population. However, it may slightly reduce the duration and severity of cold symptoms in some people. The evidence does not support the idea that vitamin C can prevent colds outright, leading to a likely false rating. My confidence in this assessment is high due to the consistency of findings across multiple studies."
599,3,2389,Scientific,Medium,Antibiotics work on viruses,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Antibiotics are designed to target bacteria, not viruses. They work by attacking the cell walls, protein synthesis, or other functions of bacteria, which viruses do not possess. Viruses require a host cell to replicate and do not have the structures that antibiotics target. Therefore, antibiotics are ineffective against viral infections. This is a well-established fact in medical science."
600,3,2390,Myths,Medium,You can see the Great Wall from space,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is a common myth. While it is theoretically possible to see the Great Wall from low Earth orbit under perfect conditions, it is not easily distinguishable to the naked eye due to its narrow width and the fact that it blends in with its surroundings. Astronauts have reported that it is difficult to see without aid. Therefore, the claim is likely false."
601,3,2391,Myths,Medium,Different tongue parts taste different flavors,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that different parts of the tongue are responsible for tasting different flavors is based on an outdated and incorrect interpretation of taste maps. Scientific research has shown that all taste sensations can be detected across the tongue, although some areas may be slightly more sensitive to certain tastes. The idea of distinct regions for sweet, salty, sour, and bitter tastes is a misconception."
602,3,2392,Myths,Medium,Goldfish have 3-second memory,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that goldfish have a 3-second memory is a myth. Scientific studies have shown that goldfish can remember information for weeks or even months. They can be trained to respond to certain stimuli and remember the timing of feeding schedules, indicating a much longer memory span than 3 seconds."
603,3,2393,Myths,Medium,Bulls are enraged by red color,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that bulls are enraged by the color red is likely false. Bulls, like other cattle, are dichromats and cannot see the color red. Their aggression in bullfighting is a response to the movement of the cape, not its color. This misconception is perpetuated by cultural depictions, but scientific understanding of bovine vision supports that bulls react to motion rather than color."
604,3,2394,Myths,Medium,Bats are blind,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""bats are blind"" is a myth. Bats are not blind; they have functional eyes and can see. While many species of bats use echolocation to navigate and hunt in the dark, they also rely on their vision, which can be quite good, especially in low-light conditions."
605,3,2395,Myths,Medium,Ostriches bury heads in sand,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ostriches bury their heads in the sand is a myth. Ostriches do not actually bury their heads in the sand. This misconception likely arises from the behavior of ostriches lowering their heads to the ground to turn their eggs or to eat, which can create the illusion from a distance that their heads are buried. There is no evidence to support the idea that ostriches bury their heads in the sand to avoid danger."
606,3,2396,Myths,Medium,Lemmings commit mass suicide,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that lemmings commit mass suicide is a myth. This misconception was popularized by a 1958 Disney documentary, ""White Wilderness,"" which staged scenes of lemmings jumping off cliffs. In reality, lemmings do not intentionally kill themselves. Their population dynamics can lead to mass migrations, during which some may accidentally fall off cliffs or drown, but this is not a deliberate act of suicide."
607,3,2397,Myths,Medium,Chameleons change color to match surroundings,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that chameleons change color to match their surroundings is a common misconception. While chameleons can change color, the primary reasons are related to communication, temperature regulation, and emotional state rather than camouflage. Their color changes are influenced by factors such as light, temperature, and mood, rather than a direct attempt to match their surroundings."
608,3,2398,Myths,Medium,Touching baby birds makes parents abandon them,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that touching baby birds causes their parents to abandon them is largely a myth. Most birds have a limited sense of smell and are unlikely to detect human scent on their chicks. Therefore, touching a baby bird does not typically lead to abandonment by the parents. However, it is generally advised to avoid handling wildlife unnecessarily to prevent stress or injury to the animals."
609,3,2399,Myths,Medium,Daddy longlegs are most venomous spiders,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that daddy longlegs are the most venomous spiders is a myth. There are two common creatures referred to as ""daddy longlegs"": the harvestman (which is not a spider and lacks venom) and the cellar spider (which is a spider but not particularly venomous to humans). There is no scientific evidence supporting the idea that either is highly venomous, and the myth likely stems from a misunderstanding or exaggeration."
610,3,2400,Myths,Medium,Bumblebees shouldn't be able to fly,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""bumblebees shouldn't be able to fly"" is based on a misunderstanding of aerodynamics. Early 20th-century calculations, which were overly simplistic, suggested that bumblebee flight was impossible. However, modern aerodynamic studies have shown that bumblebees fly using a combination of rapid wing beats and complex wing movements that generate sufficient lift. This claim is a myth and has been debunked by scientific research."
611,3,2401,Myths,Medium,Glass is a slow-moving liquid,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that glass is a slow-moving liquid is a common misconception. Glass is actually an amorphous solid, meaning it lacks a long-range ordered crystal structure, but it is not a liquid. The idea that glass flows over time, such as in old windows, is not supported by scientific evidence. Studies have shown that the thickness variations in old glass are due to historical manufacturing processes, not flow."
612,3,2402,Historical,Medium,Medieval people thought Earth was flat,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that medieval people thought the Earth was flat is a misconception. Historical evidence shows that educated people in the Middle Ages, including scholars and the Church, generally understood that the Earth was spherical. This knowledge was based on ancient Greek science, particularly the works of philosophers like Pythagoras and Aristotle, and was preserved and taught throughout the medieval period. The myth of widespread belief in a flat Earth during the Middle Ages was popularized in the 19th century."
613,3,2403,Historical,Medium,Columbus proved Earth was round,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Columbus proved the Earth was round is definitely false. By the time of Columbus's voyages in the late 15th century, the educated European populace already widely accepted the Earth's roundness. This understanding dates back to ancient Greek philosophers like Pythagoras and was further supported by Aristotle and Ptolemy. Columbus's voyages did not prove the Earth's shape; rather, they were based on the already established knowledge of a spherical Earth."
614,3,2404,Scientific,Medium,Humans evolved from monkeys,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Humans evolved from monkeys"" is a common misconception. Humans and modern monkeys share a common ancestor, but humans did not evolve directly from monkeys. Instead, both humans and monkeys evolved from a now-extinct primate species. This evolutionary divergence occurred millions of years ago, leading to the separate evolutionary paths of humans and monkeys. The claim is likely false because it oversimplifies and misrepresents the complex process of human evolution."
615,3,2405,Scientific,Medium,Neanderthals were primitive,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Neanderthals were ""primitive"" is likely false when considering the evidence of their capabilities and behaviors. Neanderthals exhibited complex behaviors such as tool-making, use of fire, symbolic thought, and possibly even art and burial practices. They had a similar brain size to modern humans and adapted to various environments across Europe and Asia. The term ""primitive"" is often used pejoratively and does not accurately reflect the sophistication of Neanderthal culture and abilities."
616,3,2406,Scientific,Medium,Dinosaurs and humans coexisted,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The scientific consensus, based on extensive fossil evidence and radiometric dating, is that non-avian dinosaurs went extinct approximately 66 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period. Humans, on the other hand, evolved much later, with the earliest Homo species appearing around 2.8 million years ago. There is no credible evidence to support the claim that dinosaurs and humans coexisted."
617,3,2407,Scientific,Medium,T-Rex arms were useless,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that T-Rex arms were ""useless"" is likely false. While T-Rex arms were relatively small compared to its body size, research suggests they had strong muscles and could have been used for specific functions such as holding prey, aiding in balance, or mating. The exact purpose is still debated, but the arms were not entirely without function."
618,3,2408,Scientific,Medium,All dinosaurs were reptiles,FALSE,TRUE,90.0%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Dinosaurs are traditionally classified as reptiles, as they belong to the clade Dinosauria within the larger group of reptiles. However, the classification of dinosaurs as reptiles is based on traditional taxonomy. Modern understanding of phylogenetics shows that birds are a subgroup of theropod dinosaurs, which complicates the classification. Birds are not typically considered reptiles in the traditional sense, but they are part of the dinosaur lineage. Therefore, while all non-avian dinosaurs are considered reptiles, the inclusion of birds in the dinosaur group makes the statement less straightforward."
619,3,2409,Scientific,Medium,Pterodactyls were dinosaurs,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Pterodactyls were not dinosaurs; they were flying reptiles known as pterosaurs. While they lived during the same time period as dinosaurs, they belong to a different group of reptiles. Dinosaurs are a distinct clade that includes creatures like the Tyrannosaurus rex and Triceratops, but not pterosaurs."
620,3,2410,Scientific,Medium,Dinosaurs were cold-blooded,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that dinosaurs were cold-blooded is uncertain. Traditionally, dinosaurs were thought to be cold-blooded like modern reptiles. However, more recent evidence suggests that some dinosaurs may have been warm-blooded or had metabolic rates in between cold- and warm-blooded animals. The debate is ongoing, with different species potentially having different metabolic characteristics."
621,3,2411,Scientific,Medium,Asteroid killed all dinosaurs instantly,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that an asteroid killed all dinosaurs instantly is likely false. While a massive asteroid impact around 66 million years ago is widely believed to have caused the mass extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs, it did not kill them all instantly. The impact would have caused immediate destruction in the vicinity, but the extinction process involved subsequent environmental changes, such as drastic climate shifts and disruptions to the food chain, which took place over a longer period."
622,3,2412,Scientific,Medium,Neanderthals couldn't speak,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Neanderthals couldn't speak is likely false. Evidence suggests that Neanderthals had the anatomical structures necessary for speech, such as the hyoid bone, which is similar to that of modern humans. Genetic studies have also shown that Neanderthals possessed the FOXP2 gene, associated with language ability in humans. While we cannot be certain of the complexity of their language, the evidence indicates they had the capability for some form of speech."
623,3,2413,Historical,Medium,Cave people lived in caves,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The term ""cave people"" generally refers to prehistoric humans who are believed to have used caves as shelters. Archaeological evidence supports that some prehistoric humans did indeed live in caves, as evidenced by cave paintings and artifacts found in such locations. However, not all prehistoric humans lived in caves; many lived in other types of shelters. Therefore, while the claim is likely true for some groups, it is not universally applicable to all prehistoric humans."
624,3,2414,Historical,Medium,Vikings had horned helmets,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"There is no archaeological evidence to support the claim that Vikings wore horned helmets. This image is largely a product of 19th-century romanticism and popular culture, rather than historical fact. Viking helmets that have been discovered are typically simple and conical, without horns."
625,3,2415,Historical,Medium,Medieval armor was too heavy to move,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that medieval armor was too heavy to move is definitely false. Historical evidence and modern experiments show that while medieval armor was indeed heavy, typically weighing between 45 to 60 pounds, it was designed to allow knights to move, fight, and even mount horses. Knights trained extensively to wear and maneuver in armor, and there are numerous accounts and depictions of knights engaging in combat, tournaments, and other activities while armored."
626,3,2416,Historical,Medium,Knights rescued damsels in distress,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The idea of knights rescuing damsels in distress is largely a romanticized notion popularized by medieval literature and later adaptations, such as fairy tales and chivalric romances. While there may have been instances where knights helped women in need, the concept is more myth than historical reality. The role of knights was primarily military, and the ""damsel in distress"" trope is a narrative device rather than a common historical occurrence."
627,3,2417,Historical,Medium,Witches were burned in Salem,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that witches were burned in Salem is definitely false. During the Salem witch trials of 1692, no accused witches were burned at the stake. Instead, 19 people were hanged, and one person was pressed to death with heavy stones. Burning was not a method of execution used in Salem."
628,3,2418,Historical,Medium,Iron maiden was medieval torture device,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The iron maiden is often depicted as a medieval torture device, but historical evidence suggests it was not used during the medieval period. The concept of the iron maiden appears to have been popularized in the 18th and 19th centuries, possibly as a myth or exaggeration of medieval practices. There is little to no credible evidence that such devices were used in the Middle Ages, making the claim likely false."
629,3,2419,Historical,Medium,Chastity belts were used in Crusades,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that chastity belts were used during the Crusades is likely false. Historical evidence suggests that the concept of chastity belts as a medieval practice is largely a myth. Most existing examples of chastity belts date from the 16th century or later, and there is little to no credible evidence supporting their use during the time of the Crusades (11th to 13th centuries). The idea of chastity belts during the Crusades appears to be a later invention, possibly from the Renaissance or Victorian periods, when such myths were popularized."
630,3,2420,Historical,Medium,Napoleon was very short,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Napoleon was very short is likely false. Historical records indicate that Napoleon Bonaparte was around 5 feet 6 inches tall, which was average height for a Frenchman of his time. The perception of him being short may have been due to a mix-up between French and English measurement units and British propaganda."
631,3,2421,Historical,Medium,George Washington had wooden teeth,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that George Washington had wooden teeth is a common myth. Historical evidence shows that his dentures were made from materials such as human teeth, animal teeth, ivory, and metal alloys, but not wood. The misconception may have arisen from the appearance of the dentures, which could have been stained and looked like wood."
632,3,2422,Historical,Medium,Benjamin Franklin discovered electricity,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Benjamin Franklin ""discovered"" electricity is misleading. Electricity was known to exist before Franklin's experiments. What Franklin did was demonstrate the connection between lightning and electricity through his famous kite experiment, contributing to the understanding of electrical phenomena. Therefore, while he made significant contributions to the study of electricity, he did not discover it."
633,3,2423,Historical,Medium,Einstein failed math,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Einstein failed math is a myth. Albert Einstein himself refuted this claim, stating that he had mastered differential and integral calculus before he was 15. Historical records and his academic performance indicate that he was proficient in mathematics from a young age."
634,3,2424,Historical,Medium,Nero fiddled while Rome burned,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""Nero fiddled while Rome burned"" is likely false. Historical evidence suggests that the fiddle did not exist during Nero's time; the violin family of instruments was developed much later. Additionally, contemporary accounts, such as those by Tacitus, do not support the idea that Nero played music during the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD. Instead, some sources suggest he was not in Rome when the fire started and that he took measures to aid the city's recovery. The phrase has become a metaphor for neglectful leadership rather than a factual historical account."
635,3,2425,Historical,Medium,Marie Antoinette said 'Let them eat cake',FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Marie Antoinette said ""Let them eat cake"" is widely regarded as apocryphal. There is no credible historical evidence that she ever uttered this phrase. The quote is often attributed to her as a symbol of her perceived indifference to the plight of the poor, but it likely originated from earlier sources, possibly being attributed to other figures before her time. Historians generally agree that it is unlikely she made this statement."
636,3,2426,Historical,Medium,Mussolini made trains run on time,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Mussolini made trains run on time is largely a myth. While Mussolini's regime did focus on improving infrastructure, including the railways, many of the improvements attributed to him were already underway before he came to power. Additionally, the Italian state railways were known for exaggerating punctuality statistics to promote the regime's image. Historical evidence suggests that while there were some improvements, the extent to which Mussolini personally influenced the punctuality of trains is overstated."
637,3,2427,Historical,Medium,The pyramids were built by slaves,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Recent archaeological evidence suggests that the pyramids were not built by slaves but by a workforce of paid laborers. Excavations have uncovered workers' villages and burial sites that indicate these laborers were well-fed and respected, contradicting the notion of slave labor. While earlier historical narratives often depicted slaves as the builders, modern scholarship largely disputes this claim."
638,3,2428,Historical,Medium,Cleopatra was Egyptian ethnically,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Cleopatra VII, the last active ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, was ethnically Macedonian Greek. The Ptolemaic dynasty, to which she belonged, was established by Ptolemy I Soter, a companion of Alexander the Great, and was of Greek origin. While Cleopatra was born in Egypt and ruled as its queen, her ancestry was primarily Greek, with little evidence of Egyptian ethnicity."
639,3,2429,Historical,Medium,Julius Caesar was born by C-section,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Julius Caesar was born by C-section is likely false. Historical evidence suggests that C-sections in ancient times were typically performed only when the mother was dead or dying, as the procedure was almost always fatal for the mother. Caesar's mother, Aurelia, is known to have survived his birth, making it improbable that he was delivered by C-section. The association of Caesar's name with the procedure is likely a later myth or misunderstanding."
640,3,2430,Historical,Medium,Paul Revere shouted 'The British are coming',FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Historical evidence suggests that Paul Revere did not shout ""The British are coming"" during his famous midnight ride. Instead, he likely used a more discreet warning, such as ""The Regulars are coming out,"" to avoid alerting British patrols and because many colonists still considered themselves British. The popular phrase is a simplification and dramatization of the event."
641,3,2431,Historical,Medium,Cowboys wore cowboy hats,FALSE,TRUE,90.0%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that cowboys wore cowboy hats is definitely true. Historical evidence and cultural depictions consistently show that cowboy hats were a common and practical choice for cowboys, providing protection from the sun and rain. While not every cowboy may have worn a cowboy hat at all times, it is a defining element of the cowboy image and attire."
642,3,2432,Historical,Medium,Wild West had frequent shootouts,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The popular image of the Wild West as a place of frequent shootouts is largely a myth perpetuated by movies and folklore. Historical records indicate that while there were some notable gunfights, they were not as common as often portrayed. Many towns had strict gun control laws, and most disputes were settled without violence."
643,3,2433,Historical,Medium,Pirates made people walk the plank,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The idea of pirates making people walk the plank is a popular trope in fiction and media, but historical evidence supporting this practice is sparse. While there are a few documented instances, they are rare and not representative of common pirate behavior. Most historical accounts suggest that pirates used other methods of punishment or execution."
644,3,2434,Historical,Medium,Pirates buried treasure,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The popular image of pirates burying treasure is largely a myth popularized by fiction, such as Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Treasure Island."" Historical evidence suggests that pirates typically spent or traded their loot rather than burying it. While there may be isolated instances of pirates hiding valuables, it was not a common practice."
645,3,2435,Historical,Medium,Vikings discovered America first,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Vikings discovered America first is likely true, as there is substantial evidence that Norse explorers, led by Leif Erikson, reached parts of North America, specifically Newfoundland in Canada, around the year 1000 AD. This predates Christopher Columbus's voyage in 1492. Archaeological findings at L'Anse aux Meadows support this claim. However, it's important to note that indigenous peoples were present in the Americas long before the Vikings."
646,3,2436,Historical,Medium,Leif Erikson reached North America,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Historical evidence and Norse sagas, such as the Saga of the Greenlanders and the Saga of Erik the Red, suggest that Leif Erikson, a Norse explorer, reached North America around the year 1000 AD. Archaeological findings at L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland, Canada, support the presence of Norse settlers in North America, aligning with the time period of Erikson's voyages. While some details of the sagas are debated, the consensus among historians is that Leif Erikson did indeed reach North America."
647,3,2437,Historical,Medium,"The Pinta, Nina, and Santa Maria were large ships",FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The Pinta, Nina, and Santa Maria were not considered large ships by the standards of their time. The Santa Maria, the largest of the three, was a medium-sized carrack, while the Pinta and Nina were smaller caravels. These ships were relatively small compared to other vessels used for long voyages in later centuries."
648,3,2438,Historical,Medium,Pocahontas saved John Smith,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The story of Pocahontas saving John Smith is primarily based on Smith's own accounts, which he wrote years after the alleged event. Historians debate the accuracy of his narrative, as it may have been exaggerated or misinterpreted. Some suggest it could have been a ritual misunderstood by Smith. There is no corroborating evidence from other contemporary sources, making the claim uncertain."
649,3,2439,Historical,Medium,Pocahontas married John Smith,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Pocahontas married John Smith is definitely false. Historical records clearly indicate that Pocahontas married John Rolfe, not John Smith. John Smith was an English explorer who had interactions with Pocahontas, but there is no evidence of a marriage between them."
650,3,2440,Historical,Medium,Thanksgiving was always in November,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Thanksgiving has not always been in November. The first Thanksgiving in 1621 did not have a fixed date and was celebrated in late autumn. It wasn't until 1863 that President Abraham Lincoln proclaimed a national Thanksgiving Day to be celebrated in November. Prior to this, Thanksgiving dates varied by state and were not consistently in November."
651,3,2441,Historical,Medium,Pilgrims wore black and white,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The common image of Pilgrims wearing black and white clothing is largely a myth. Historical evidence suggests that Pilgrims wore a variety of colors, including reds, greens, browns, and blues. The black and white attire is more reflective of Puritan fashion in England during the late 17th century, not the early 17th-century Pilgrims. This misconception likely arose from later artistic depictions and cultural stereotypes."
652,3,2442,Historical,Medium,Pilgrims and Native Americans were friends,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The relationship between the Pilgrims and Native Americans was complex and varied over time. Initially, there were instances of cooperation and mutual assistance, such as the Pilgrims receiving help from the Wampanoag tribe, which included the famous 1621 harvest celebration often referred to as the ""First Thanksgiving."" However, this relationship was not uniformly friendly and deteriorated over time due to cultural misunderstandings, competition for resources, and expansion of European settlements, leading to conflicts such as King Philip's War. Thus, the claim is an oversimplification of a nuanced historical relationship."
653,3,2443,Historical,Medium,Native Americans didn't use the wheel,FALSE,TRUE,90.0%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Native Americans didn't use the wheel is likely true in the context of pre-Columbian societies in the Americas. While the wheel was known and used in some Mesoamerican cultures for toys, it was not utilized for practical purposes like transportation or machinery. This was largely due to the absence of large domesticated animals for pulling wheeled vehicles and the challenging terrain that made wheeled transport less practical. However, the concept of the wheel was not entirely unknown, which is why the claim is rated as likely true rather than definitely true."
654,3,2444,Historical,Medium,Columbus discovered tobacco,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Tobacco was already used by indigenous peoples in the Americas long before Columbus arrived. While Columbus and his crew were among the first Europeans to encounter tobacco, they did not ""discover"" it in the sense of being the first to find or use it. The claim is likely false because it overlooks the pre-existing knowledge and use of tobacco by native populations."
655,3,2445,Historical,Medium,Tomatoes were thought poisonous in Europe,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that tomatoes were thought to be poisonous in Europe is likely true. When tomatoes were introduced to Europe from the Americas in the 16th century, they were initially met with suspicion. This was partly because tomatoes are part of the nightshade family, which includes some toxic plants. Additionally, the acidic nature of tomatoes could leach lead from pewter plates, causing lead poisoning, which may have contributed to their reputation. Over time, as culinary practices evolved and understanding improved, tomatoes became a staple in European cuisine."
656,3,2446,Historical,Medium,Potatoes caused Irish famine,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""potatoes caused the Irish famine"" is misleading. The Irish Potato Famine, which occurred from 1845 to 1852, was primarily caused by a potato disease known as late blight (Phytophthora infestans) that devastated the potato crop, which was a staple food in Ireland. However, the famine was exacerbated by socio-economic factors, including British political policies, land ownership issues, and inadequate relief efforts. Thus, while the failure of the potato crop was a trigger, it was not the sole cause of the famine."
657,3,2447,Historical,Medium,Tea caused Boston Tea Party,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The Boston Tea Party was a political protest against the British government's Tea Act of 1773, which granted the British East India Company a monopoly on tea sales in the American colonies. While the event was directly related to tea, it was more about the colonists' opposition to taxation without representation and British economic policies. Thus, tea was a significant factor but not the sole cause."
658,3,2448,Historical,Medium,Shot heard round the world was literal,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The phrase ""shot heard round the world"" is a metaphorical expression, not a literal one. It refers to the first shot of the American Revolutionary War at the Battles of Lexington and Concord in 1775, symbolizing the start of a significant global event. It was not literally heard around the world, but its impact was felt globally."
659,3,2449,Historical,Medium,Declaration signed on July 4th,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4th is likely false. While the Continental Congress adopted the Declaration on July 4, 1776, most delegates did not sign it until August 2, 1776. Historical evidence indicates that only a few signatures, including that of John Hancock, may have been added on July 4th."
660,3,2450,Historical,Medium,Liberty Bell cracked on July 4th,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The Liberty Bell did not crack on July 4th. Historical records indicate that the bell first cracked shortly after its arrival in Philadelphia in 1752. It was recast twice due to the initial crack. The most famous crack, which rendered the bell unringable, occurred in the early 19th century, likely in the 1840s. There is no historical evidence to support the claim that the Liberty Bell cracked on July 4th."
661,3,2451,Historical,Medium,Betsy Ross designed the flag,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Betsy Ross designed the first American flag is largely based on family lore and lacks substantial historical evidence. The story was popularized in the late 19th century by her grandson, William Canby, but there are no contemporary records from the Revolutionary period to support this claim. While she was a seamstress and may have sewn flags, the design attribution is not well-documented."
662,3,2452,Historical,Medium,Star Spangled Banner written during War of 1812,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim is definitely true. ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" was written by Francis Scott Key during the War of 1812. Specifically, Key wrote the lyrics in September 1814 after witnessing the bombardment of Fort McHenry by British forces. The historical context and timing align with the events of the War of 1812."
663,3,2453,Historical,Medium,White House was always white,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The White House was not always white. Originally, the building was constructed with grayish sandstone. It was first painted white in 1798 to protect the porous stone from freezing and cracking during winter. Therefore, the claim that the White House was always white is likely false."
664,3,2454,Historical,Medium,Lincoln wrote Gettysburg Address on envelope,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that Lincoln wrote the Gettysburg Address on an envelope is a popular myth. Historical evidence suggests that Lincoln prepared multiple drafts of the speech, with the first draft written on White House stationery. The story of the envelope likely arose from the idea that Lincoln wrote the speech hastily on his way to Gettysburg, but this is not supported by historical documentation."
665,3,2455,Historical,Medium,Lincoln freed all slaves with Emancipation,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The Emancipation Proclamation, issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863, declared the freedom of slaves in the Confederate states that were in rebellion against the Union. However, it did not apply to slave-holding border states that remained loyal to the Union or areas of the Confederacy that had already come under Union control. Therefore, it did not free all slaves in the United States. The complete abolition of slavery was achieved with the ratification of the 13th Amendment in December 1865."
666,3,2456,Historical,Medium,Civil War was only about slavery,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The American Civil War was primarily about slavery, as evidenced by declarations from seceding states and speeches by Confederate leaders. However, it also involved other factors such as states' rights, economic differences, and political power struggles. While slavery was the central issue, it was not the sole factor, making the claim likely false."
667,3,2457,Historical,Medium,Grant was a drunk,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Ulysses S. Grant, the 18th President of the United States and a prominent Union general during the Civil War, was known to have struggled with alcohol at various points in his life. Historical accounts and personal testimonies suggest that he did have issues with drinking, particularly during periods of inactivity or stress. However, the extent of his drinking and its impact on his military and political career is debated among historians. While there is evidence to support the claim that he had problems with alcohol, labeling him simply as ""a drunk"" may oversimplify the complexities of his life and career."
668,3,2458,Historical,Medium,Lee owned slaves reluctantly,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Historical evidence suggests that Robert E. Lee, while reportedly expressing personal ambivalence about slavery, actively managed and enforced the institution on the estate he inherited from his father-in-law. Lee's actions, such as using legal means to delay the emancipation of enslaved people and his involvement in punishing those who attempted to escape, indicate a more complex relationship with slavery than mere reluctance. Therefore, the claim that he owned slaves reluctantly is likely false, as his actions do not fully align with reluctance."
669,3,2459,Historical,Medium,Reconstruction succeeded,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The success of Reconstruction is a complex and debated topic. Reconstruction (1865-1877) had some successes, such as the passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments, which abolished slavery and granted citizenship and voting rights to African Americans. However, it also faced significant failures, including the rise of Jim Crow laws, the resurgence of white supremacist groups, and the eventual withdrawal of federal troops from the South, which led to the disenfranchisement and segregation of African Americans. The mixed outcomes make it difficult to definitively categorize Reconstruction as a success or failure."
670,3,2460,Historical,Medium,Jim Crow laws were unofficial,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Jim Crow laws were official state and local laws enacted in the United States, primarily in the Southern states, from the late 19th century until the mid-20th century. These laws mandated racial segregation and disenfranchised African Americans. They were legally enforced and not unofficial, making the claim that they were ""unofficial"" definitely false."

In reality, individuals or groups can have neutral, mixed, or independent positions that do not align strictly with being ""for"" or ""against"" a particular side. This oversimplification does not account for the complexity of most issues, making the claim likely false."
674,3,2464,Logic_Reasoning,Hard,My father has two sons and I have two brothers,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim is likely false because if the speaker's father has two sons, one of them is the speaker. Therefore, the speaker can only have one brother, not two. The statement is internally inconsistent."

The presence of more firefighters is typically a response to larger or more severe fires, which inherently cause more damage. The correlation between the number of firefighters and the extent of damage is not causal; rather, both are effects of the fire's severity. Therefore, the claim misunderstands the relationship between these variables."

786,3,2576,Scientific,Medium,Bacteria are single-celled organisms,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Bacteria are indeed single-celled organisms. They are classified as prokaryotes, which are unicellular organisms that lack a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. This is a well-established fact in microbiology."
787,3,2577,Scientific,Medium,Viruses are living organisms,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Viruses are not considered living organisms by most scientists because they lack key characteristics of life, such as the ability to reproduce independently and carry out metabolic processes. They require a host cell to replicate, which distinguishes them from living organisms that can reproduce on their own. However, some debate exists in the scientific community, which slightly affects the certainty of this classification."
788,3,2578,Scientific,Medium,Antibiotics kill viruses,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Antibiotics are designed to target bacteria, not viruses. They work by attacking the cell walls, protein synthesis, or DNA replication of bacteria, which are not features of viruses. Therefore, antibiotics are ineffective against viral infections."

However, not all vaccines use dead viruses; some use live attenuated viruses, viral vectors, or mRNA technology. Therefore, the claim is likely true but not universally applicable to all vaccines."
790,3,2580,Scientific,Medium,Blood type O is universal donor,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that blood type O is the universal donor is mostly true but requires clarification. Specifically, blood type O negative (O-) is considered the universal donor for red blood cells because it lacks A, B, and Rh antigens, minimizing the risk of an immune reaction in recipients of any blood type. However, not all type O blood is universal; only O- has this universal donor status. Therefore, the claim is likely true with the understanding that it specifically refers to O negative blood."
791,3,2581,Scientific,Medium,Humans have 206 bones as adults,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that humans have 206 bones as adults is a well-established fact in human anatomy. While infants are born with approximately 270 bones, some of these bones fuse together during growth, resulting in the standard count of 206 bones in a typical adult human skeleton. This information is consistently supported by anatomical studies and textbooks."
792,3,2582,Scientific,Medium,The heart has four chambers,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the heart has four chambers is definitely true. In humans and other mammals, the heart is anatomically divided into four chambers: two atria (the left atrium and the right atrium) and two ventricles (the left ventricle and the right ventricle). This structure is well-documented in medical and biological sciences."
793,3,2583,Scientific,Medium,The brain uses most of body's energy,FALSE,TRUE,90.0%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The brain, while only accounting for about 2% of body weight, uses approximately 20% of the body's energy at rest. This is a significant portion, but it is not the majority of the body's energy. Other organs and systems, such as muscles, also consume substantial amounts of energy, especially during physical activity. Therefore, while the brain is a major energy consumer, it does not use most of the body's energy."
794,3,2584,Scientific,Medium,Neurons can regenerate easily,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Traditionally, it was believed that neurons in the adult human brain do not regenerate. However, recent research has shown that certain areas of the brain, such as the hippocampus, can generate new neurons, a process known as neurogenesis. Despite this, the overall ability for neurons to regenerate is limited and not ""easy"" compared to other cell types in the body. Therefore, the claim that neurons can regenerate easily is likely false."
795,3,2585,Scientific,Medium,The liver can regenerate,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The liver is well-documented in scientific literature as having the ability to regenerate. It can regrow to its original size even after significant portions have been removed, as long as the remaining tissue is healthy. This regenerative capacity is a unique and well-established characteristic of the liver among human organs."
796,3,2586,Scientific,Medium,Kidneys filter blood,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""kidneys filter blood"" is definitely true. Kidneys are vital organs in the human body responsible for filtering waste products and excess substances from the blood, which are then excreted as urine. This function is well-documented in medical literature and is a fundamental aspect of human physiology."
797,3,2587,Scientific,Medium,The appendix is completely useless,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the appendix is completely useless is likely false. While historically considered a vestigial organ with no function, recent research suggests that the appendix may play a role in gut health by serving as a reservoir for beneficial bacteria. This function can be important in repopulating the gut microbiome after disturbances such as infections. Therefore, the appendix is not completely useless, although it is not essential for survival."
798,3,2588,Scientific,Medium,Tonsils serve no purpose,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Tonsils are part of the lymphatic system and play a role in the immune response by trapping pathogens that enter through the mouth and nose. They help produce antibodies and white blood cells to fight infections. While they can be removed if they cause health issues, they do serve a purpose in the body's defense system."
799,3,2589,Scientific,Medium,Wisdom teeth are vestigial,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Wisdom teeth are often considered vestigial because they are remnants of a time when human ancestors had larger jaws and needed extra molars to help chew a diet of rougher foods. In modern humans, smaller jaws often do not have enough space for these teeth, leading to common issues such as impaction. While not all wisdom teeth are problematic, their reduced functionality and frequent removal in contemporary populations support the idea that they are vestigial."
800,3,2590,Scientific,Medium,Fingerprints are unique,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Fingerprints are generally considered unique to each individual, and this belief is widely accepted in forensic science. However, there is a small possibility of similarities, especially in partial prints, and identical twins can have very similar patterns. While the uniqueness of fingerprints is a strong assumption, it is not absolutely proven beyond all doubt, hence the score reflects a high likelihood rather than certainty."
801,3,2591,Scientific,Medium,Identical twins have same DNA,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Identical twins originate from the same fertilized egg, which means they start with the same DNA. However, mutations can occur during cell division, leading to slight genetic differences. Additionally, environmental factors can cause epigenetic changes that affect gene expression. While they have nearly identical DNA, these small differences mean the claim is not entirely accurate."
802,3,2592,Scientific,Medium,Blood is red because of iron,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Blood is red primarily due to the presence of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that contains iron. The iron in hemoglobin binds with oxygen, and this interaction gives blood its red color. While iron is a crucial component, the red color specifically results from the way hemoglobin absorbs and reflects light. Therefore, the claim is likely true, but it simplifies the explanation by not mentioning hemoglobin's role."
803,3,2593,Scientific,Medium,Veins carry blue blood,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Blood is never actually blue. Veins appear blue due to the way light penetrates the skin and is absorbed and scattered by the tissues. Blood in veins is deoxygenated, which makes it darker red, but it is not blue. The perception of blue veins is an optical illusion."
804,3,2594,Scientific,Medium,The tongue map is accurate,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The ""tongue map"" is a widely debunked concept that suggests different parts of the tongue are responsible for tasting different flavors (sweet, salty, sour, bitter). Scientific research has shown that taste receptors for all flavors are distributed across the tongue, not confined to specific areas. This claim is likely false based on current scientific understanding."
805,3,2595,Scientific,Medium,Humans have only five senses,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that humans have only five senses is likely false. While traditionally, humans are said to have five senses (sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch), scientific understanding recognizes additional senses. These include balance (vestibular sense), temperature (thermoception), pain (nociception), and body position (proprioception), among others. Therefore, the concept of only five senses is an oversimplification."
806,3,2596,Scientific,Medium,The skin is the largest organ,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the skin is the largest organ is widely accepted and supported by scientific evidence. The skin covers the entire body, accounting for about 16% of a person's body weight and spanning an average area of 1.5 to 2 square meters in adults. This makes it the largest organ by surface area and weight."
807,3,2597,Scientific,Medium,Hair and nails are alive,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Hair and nails are composed of keratin, a protein, and are not alive. The cells that produce hair and nails are alive, but the hair and nails themselves are not. Once the cells die, they form the hair and nails, which are non-living structures."
808,3,2598,Scientific,Medium,Goosebumps are vestigial,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Goosebumps are considered vestigial because they are a remnant of a physiological response that was more useful to our ancestors. In animals with fur, the contraction of tiny muscles at the base of hair follicles causes the hair to stand up, providing insulation and making the animal appear larger to predators. In humans, this response is largely redundant due to our lack of dense body hair, making goosebumps a vestigial reflex."
809,3,2599,Scientific,Medium,Hiccups serve no purpose,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The purpose of hiccups is not definitively understood, and there is no consensus in the scientific community about their function. Some theories suggest they may be a vestigial reflex or serve a developmental role in fetuses, but these are not conclusively proven. Therefore, the claim that hiccups serve no purpose is uncertain."
810,3,2600,Scientific,Medium,Yawning is contagious,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that yawning is contagious is supported by various studies in psychology and neuroscience. Research indicates that seeing, hearing, or even thinking about yawning can trigger yawning in others, suggesting a social and empathetic component. However, not everyone is susceptible to contagious yawning, and the exact mechanisms are not fully understood, which is why the claim is rated as likely true rather than definitely true."
811,3,2601,Scientific,Medium,Stretching prevents injuries,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that stretching prevents injuries is widely believed, but scientific evidence is mixed. Some studies suggest that stretching can improve flexibility and range of motion, which might reduce the risk of certain injuries. However, other research indicates that stretching alone does not significantly prevent injuries, especially acute injuries. The effectiveness of stretching may depend on the type of activity, the individual, and how stretching is incorporated into a broader warm-up routine. Therefore, the claim is uncertain and context-dependent."
812,3,2602,Scientific,Medium,Muscle turns to fat if you stop exercising,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Muscle and fat are two distinct types of tissue with different functions and structures. Muscle cannot physically transform into fat. If you stop exercising, muscle mass may decrease due to atrophy, and if caloric intake exceeds expenditure, fat may accumulate. However, this is not a transformation of muscle into fat."
813,3,2603,Scientific,Medium,Lactic acid causes muscle soreness,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that lactic acid causes muscle soreness is likely false. Current scientific understanding indicates that lactic acid is not responsible for muscle soreness, which is more accurately attributed to microscopic damage to muscle fibers and the resulting inflammation, known as delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Lactic acid is produced during intense exercise, but it is cleared from the muscles relatively quickly and does not persist long enough to cause soreness."
814,3,2604,Scientific,Medium,"No pain, no gain is true",FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The phrase ""No pain, no gain"" is often used to suggest that effort and struggle are necessary for improvement, particularly in physical fitness. While some discomfort can be a part of growth and progress, especially in exercise, pain is not always a reliable indicator of gain. Overexertion and injury can result from ignoring pain, which is the body's signal that something may be wrong. Therefore, the truthfulness of the claim depends on context and interpretation, making it uncertain or unclear."
815,3,2605,Scientific,Medium,Spot reduction of fat is possible,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The concept of spot reduction, which suggests that exercising a specific area of the body will result in fat loss in that area, is largely unsupported by scientific evidence. Studies have shown that fat loss tends to occur more uniformly across the body rather than in targeted areas. While muscle toning can occur in specific areas through targeted exercises, this does not equate to localized fat loss. Therefore, the claim is likely false."
816,3,2606,Scientific,Medium,Metabolism slows drastically with age,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"While metabolism does tend to slow with age, the change is generally gradual rather than drastic. Research indicates that metabolic rate decreases at a modest rate, often due to factors like loss of muscle mass and changes in physical activity levels, rather than age itself. The claim that metabolism slows ""drastically"" is an exaggeration of the typical metabolic changes associated with aging."
817,3,2607,Myths,Medium,Eating late causes weight gain,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that eating late causes weight gain is not definitively supported by scientific evidence. Weight gain is primarily determined by the balance between calories consumed and calories expended. However, some studies suggest that eating late may be associated with weight gain due to factors like increased calorie intake, poorer food choices, or disrupted circadian rhythms. The evidence is mixed, and individual factors such as lifestyle and metabolism play significant roles. Therefore, the claim remains uncertain and context-dependent."
818,3,2608,Myths,Medium,Breakfast is the most important meal,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""breakfast is the most important meal"" is widely debated. Some studies suggest that eating breakfast can improve concentration and metabolism, while others indicate that skipping breakfast does not necessarily have negative health effects. The importance of breakfast may vary based on individual health needs, lifestyle, and dietary habits. Therefore, the claim is uncertain and context-dependent."
819,3,2609,Scientific,Medium,Eating eggs raises cholesterol,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The relationship between egg consumption and cholesterol levels is complex. While eggs are high in dietary cholesterol, recent research suggests that for most people, eating eggs does not significantly impact blood cholesterol levels or increase the risk of heart disease. However, individual responses can vary, and some people may experience a rise in cholesterol levels. The claim is uncertain because it depends on individual health factors and dietary context."
820,3,2610,Scientific,Medium,Fat makes you fat,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Fat makes you fat"" is an oversimplification. Dietary fat itself does not directly cause weight gain; rather, consuming more calories than the body needs, regardless of the source, leads to weight gain. Fat is calorie-dense, so it can contribute to a caloric surplus if consumed in excess. However, fats are also essential for various bodily functions and can be part of a healthy diet. The relationship between dietary fat and body fat is complex and influenced by overall diet, lifestyle, and individual metabolism."
821,3,2611,Scientific,Medium,Carbs make you fat,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""carbs make you fat"" is an oversimplification. Weight gain occurs when there is a caloric surplus, regardless of whether those calories come from carbohydrates, fats, or proteins. Carbohydrates themselves do not inherently cause weight gain; rather, it is the overconsumption of calories in general that leads to fat accumulation. Additionally, carbohydrates are an essential part of a balanced diet, providing energy and nutrients. Therefore, the claim is likely false, and my confidence in this assessment is high based on current nutritional science."
822,3,2612,Scientific,Medium,Protein builds muscle,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Protein is essential for muscle growth as it provides the necessary amino acids for muscle repair and synthesis. However, protein alone does not build muscle; resistance training and other factors like overall nutrition and rest are also crucial. Therefore, while protein is a key component in muscle building, it is not the sole factor."
823,3,2613,Scientific,Medium,Gluten is bad for everyone,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. It is harmful to individuals with celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, or wheat allergy. However, for the majority of the population without these conditions, gluten is not inherently bad and can be part of a healthy diet. The claim that gluten is bad for everyone lacks scientific support and is likely false."
824,3,2614,Myths,Medium,Dairy causes mucus,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The belief that dairy causes mucus production is a common misconception. Scientific studies have not found a direct link between dairy consumption and increased mucus production. Some individuals may feel a thicker sensation in their mouth or throat after consuming dairy, but this is not due to increased mucus. This sensation is likely due to the texture of dairy products. Therefore, the claim is likely false."
825,3,2615,Scientific,Medium,Sugar causes diabetes,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that sugar directly causes diabetes is likely false. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition unrelated to sugar intake. Type 2 diabetes is influenced by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors, including obesity and physical inactivity. While excessive sugar consumption can lead to weight gain, which is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, sugar itself is not a direct cause. The relationship is more about overall diet and lifestyle rather than sugar alone."
826,3,2616,Myths,Medium,Coffee stunts growth,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that coffee stunts growth is a myth with no scientific evidence supporting it. Research has not found any direct link between coffee consumption and inhibited growth in children or adolescents. The misconception may stem from concerns about caffeine affecting calcium absorption, but studies have shown that normal coffee consumption does not have a significant impact on bone health or growth."
827,3,2617,Scientific,Medium,Drinking water flushes toxins,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Drinking water supports the body's natural detoxification processes by aiding kidney function, which filters waste from the blood and excretes it in urine. While water itself doesn't ""flush"" toxins, it is essential for maintaining the body's ability to remove waste efficiently. However, the term ""toxins"" is often vague and can be misleading, as the body has specific mechanisms for detoxification."
828,3,2618,Scientific,Medium,Activated charcoal detoxifies,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Activated charcoal is known to bind to certain toxins and drugs in the gastrointestinal tract, which can prevent their absorption and is used in medical settings for specific types of poisoning. However, the claim that it ""detoxifies"" in a general sense, such as removing toxins from the body or skin, lacks scientific evidence. The term ""detoxify"" is often used in marketing without clear definition or support from rigorous studies. Therefore, while activated charcoal has specific medical uses, the broader claim of detoxification is likely false."
829,3,2619,Scientific,Medium,Cleanse diets work,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Cleanse diets, often marketed as detox diets, claim to remove toxins and promote weight loss. However, there is limited scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness. The human body is naturally equipped with organs like the liver and kidneys to detoxify itself. While some people may experience short-term weight loss due to calorie restriction, this is not sustainable or necessarily healthy. Additionally, cleanse diets can sometimes lead to nutrient deficiencies and other health issues. Therefore, the claim that cleanse diets work is likely false."
830,3,2620,Scientific,Medium,Superfoods exist,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The term ""superfoods"" is often used in marketing to describe foods that are purported to have exceptional health benefits due to their nutrient density. However, there is no scientific definition or criteria for what constitutes a ""superfood."" While certain foods like blueberries, kale, and quinoa are indeed nutritious and beneficial as part of a balanced diet, the concept of ""superfoods"" is not recognized by the scientific community as a distinct category. Therefore, the claim is uncertain as it relies on a non-scientific term, but it is based on the real nutritional value of certain foods."
831,3,2621,Scientific,Medium,Alkaline diet changes body pH,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that an alkaline diet can change the body's pH is likely false. The human body tightly regulates its pH levels, particularly in the blood, through various mechanisms such as respiration and kidney function. While diet can influence the pH of urine, it does not significantly alter the overall pH balance of the body. The body's pH is maintained within a narrow range, and significant deviations can be harmful. Therefore, the idea that an alkaline diet can change the body's systemic pH is not supported by scientific evidence."
832,3,2622,Scientific,Medium,Coconut oil is healthy,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Coconut oil is often marketed as a health food, but its health benefits are debated. It contains high levels of saturated fats, which can raise LDL cholesterol levels, potentially increasing heart disease risk. However, it also contains medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), which some studies suggest may have health benefits. The overall health impact of coconut oil depends on individual dietary needs and consumption levels. Therefore, the claim is uncertain and context-dependent."
833,3,2623,Scientific,Medium,Apple cider vinegar aids weight loss,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Some studies suggest that apple cider vinegar may aid weight loss by increasing feelings of fullness and potentially reducing calorie intake. However, the evidence is not robust, and the effects are generally modest. More comprehensive research is needed to confirm these findings. Therefore, while there is some support for the claim, it is not definitive."
834,3,2624,Scientific,Medium,Green tea boosts metabolism,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Several studies suggest that green tea can boost metabolism due to its caffeine content and high levels of catechins, particularly epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). These compounds are believed to increase energy expenditure and fat oxidation. However, the effect size is generally small and may vary among individuals. While the evidence supports the claim to some extent, it is not definitive for all populations or significant in magnitude."
835,3,2625,Scientific,Medium,Probiotics cure gut problems,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"While probiotics can be beneficial for certain gut-related issues, such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome, they are not a cure-all for all gut problems. The effectiveness of probiotics can vary depending on the strain, dosage, and individual differences in gut microbiota. Therefore, the claim that probiotics cure gut problems is likely false, as they may help manage symptoms but are not a definitive cure."
836,3,2626,Scientific,Medium,Multivitamins are necessary,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""multivitamins are necessary"" is likely false for most people. Scientific evidence suggests that a balanced diet typically provides the necessary vitamins and minerals for the average person. Multivitamins may be beneficial for specific groups, such as pregnant women, the elderly, or those with certain dietary restrictions or health conditions. However, they are not universally necessary for everyone."
837,3,2627,Scientific,Medium,Creatine is a steroid,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Creatine is not a steroid. It is a naturally occurring compound found in muscle cells, often used as a dietary supplement to improve exercise performance. Steroids, on the other hand, are synthetic substances that mimic hormones like testosterone. The two are chemically and functionally distinct."
838,3,2628,Scientific,Medium,Protein powder is unhealthy,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Protein powder is generally considered safe and healthy for most people when used appropriately as a dietary supplement. It can be a convenient source of protein, especially for those with increased protein needs, such as athletes or individuals with dietary restrictions. However, excessive consumption or reliance on protein powder instead of whole foods can lead to potential health issues, such as nutrient imbalances or digestive problems. The claim that protein powder is inherently unhealthy is likely false, as it depends on the context of use and individual health conditions."
839,3,2629,Scientific,Medium,Soy feminizes men,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that soy feminizes men is largely based on the presence of phytoestrogens in soy, which are plant-derived compounds with estrogen-like activity. However, scientific studies have shown that normal consumption of soy does not significantly affect testosterone levels or estrogen levels in men. The evidence does not support the idea that soy consumption leads to feminization in men. Therefore, the claim is likely false, but some uncertainty remains due to the complexity of individual dietary responses."
840,3,2630,Scientific,Medium,MSG is neurotoxic,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that MSG (monosodium glutamate) is neurotoxic is likely false. Extensive scientific research has not found conclusive evidence that MSG is neurotoxic at the levels typically consumed in food. Regulatory agencies like the FDA and EFSA consider MSG safe for consumption. Some studies suggesting neurotoxicity involve doses much higher than those found in a typical diet, which are not representative of normal human consumption."
841,3,2631,Scientific,Medium,Artificial sweeteners cause cancer,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that artificial sweeteners cause cancer is likely false based on current scientific evidence. Extensive research, including studies by the National Cancer Institute and the World Health Organization, has not found conclusive evidence linking artificial sweeteners to cancer in humans. Some studies in the past suggested a potential risk, but these were often based on animal studies with high doses not comparable to typical human consumption. Regulatory agencies like the FDA and EFSA have deemed approved artificial sweeteners safe for consumption within established limits."
842,3,2632,Scientific,Medium,Microwaves destroy nutrients,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that microwaves destroy nutrients is likely false. Cooking methods, including microwaving, can lead to some nutrient loss, but microwaving is generally efficient at preserving nutrients due to shorter cooking times and reduced exposure to heat. Studies indicate that microwaving can retain more nutrients compared to other methods like boiling. The claim oversimplifies the complex interactions between cooking methods and nutrient retention."
843,3,2633,Scientific,Medium,Raw food is more nutritious,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that raw food is more nutritious is not universally true. Some nutrients are more bioavailable in raw foods, while others become more accessible or are enhanced through cooking. For example, vitamin C can be higher in raw foods, but cooking can increase the availability of antioxidants like lycopene in tomatoes. The nutritional value of food can vary depending on the type of food and the method of preparation. Therefore, the claim is uncertain and context-dependent."
844,3,2634,Scientific,Medium,Freezing destroys nutrients,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Freezing does not destroy nutrients; rather, it preserves them by slowing down the enzymatic reactions that cause food to spoil. Some nutrients, like vitamin C, may degrade slightly during the freezing process, but the overall nutrient loss is minimal compared to other preservation methods. Therefore, the claim that freezing destroys nutrients is likely false."
845,3,2635,Scientific,Medium,Fresh is always better than frozen,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Fresh is always better than frozen"" is likely false because the nutritional value of fresh and frozen foods can be comparable. Freezing preserves nutrients effectively, and in some cases, frozen foods may retain more nutrients than fresh ones that have been stored for extended periods. Additionally, the quality of fresh produce can degrade over time, whereas freezing can lock in nutrients at their peak. Therefore, the superiority of fresh over frozen is not universally true and depends on various factors such as the type of food and storage conditions."
846,3,2636,Scientific,Medium,Organic food is pesticide-free,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Organic food is not necessarily pesticide-free. Organic farming standards allow the use of certain natural pesticides and some synthetic substances that are approved for organic production. While organic foods typically have lower pesticide residues compared to conventionally grown foods, they are not completely free of pesticides."
847,3,2637,Scientific,Medium,GMOs are unnatural,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The term ""unnatural"" is subjective and depends on one's definition of naturalness. Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are created through human intervention, which some may consider unnatural. However, humans have been altering organisms through selective breeding for thousands of years, which is a natural process of evolution. The distinction between natural and unnatural is not clear-cut, making the claim uncertain."
848,3,2638,Scientific,Medium,Hormones in milk are dangerous,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that hormones in milk are dangerous is likely false. Milk naturally contains hormones, but the levels are generally considered safe for human consumption. Regulatory bodies like the FDA and EFSA have evaluated the safety of hormones in milk, including those from cows treated with recombinant bovine somatotropin (rBST), and have found no significant risk to human health. While some people may choose to avoid milk with added hormones for personal reasons, the scientific consensus does not support the claim that these hormones are inherently dangerous."
849,3,2639,Scientific,Medium,Searing meat seals in juices,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that searing meat seals in juices is a common culinary myth. Scientific studies and cooking experiments have shown that searing does not prevent moisture loss. Instead, it primarily enhances flavor through the Maillard reaction, which browns the meat and creates a savory crust. Therefore, the claim is likely false, and my confidence in this assessment is high based on available evidence."
850,3,2640,Scientific,Medium,Alcohol kills brain cells,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that alcohol kills brain cells is largely a myth. Scientific research indicates that while excessive alcohol consumption can damage the brain and impair its function, it does not directly kill brain cells. Instead, alcohol can damage the dendrites, which are the connections between neurons, affecting communication between brain cells. Chronic alcohol abuse can lead to brain shrinkage and cognitive impairments, but this is not the same as killing brain cells outright. Therefore, the claim is likely false."
851,3,2641,Scientific,Medium,Weed is harmless,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""weed is harmless"" is likely false. While cannabis has therapeutic benefits and is considered less harmful than many other substances, it is not without risks. Potential harms include impaired cognitive function, addiction, mental health issues like anxiety or psychosis, and respiratory problems from smoking. The impact can vary based on individual factors such as age, frequency of use, and pre-existing health conditions. Therefore, it is inaccurate to label weed as entirely harmless."
852,3,2642,Scientific,Medium,Nicotine causes cancer,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Nicotine itself is not classified as a carcinogen and does not directly cause cancer. However, it is highly addictive and is a primary component of tobacco products, which contain many other harmful substances that are known to cause cancer. The confusion often arises because nicotine is associated with smoking, which is a major risk factor for cancer due to the other chemicals present in tobacco smoke."
853,3,2643,Scientific,Medium,Vaping is completely safe,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""vaping is completely safe"" is likely false. While vaping is generally considered less harmful than smoking traditional cigarettes, it is not without risks. Studies have shown that vaping can lead to respiratory issues, cardiovascular problems, and exposure to potentially harmful chemicals. The long-term health effects of vaping are still being studied, but current evidence suggests that it is not completely safe."
854,3,2644,Scientific,Medium,Cannabis is not addictive,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Cannabis can be addictive for some individuals. The condition known as Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) is recognized by medical professionals and can lead to dependence. Studies indicate that about 9% of users may develop an addiction, with higher rates among those who start using at a young age or use cannabis frequently. While not everyone who uses cannabis becomes addicted, the potential for addiction exists, making the claim ""Cannabis is not addictive"" likely false."
855,3,2645,Scientific,Medium,Psychedelics are always dangerous,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""psychedelics are always dangerous"" is likely false. While psychedelics can pose risks, especially when used irresponsibly or by individuals with certain mental health conditions, they are not inherently dangerous in all contexts. Research has shown that psychedelics can have therapeutic benefits when used in controlled settings under professional supervision. The risks associated with psychedelics often depend on factors such as dosage, setting, and individual health conditions. Therefore, the blanket statement that they are ""always dangerous"" is misleading."
856,3,2646,Scientific,Medium,Caffeine is highly addictive,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Caffeine is considered to have addictive properties, as it can lead to dependence in some individuals. Regular consumption can result in withdrawal symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, and irritability when intake is reduced or stopped. However, it is generally considered less addictive than substances like nicotine or opioids. The term ""highly addictive"" may be somewhat subjective, but evidence supports that caffeine can lead to dependence, justifying a score of likely true."
857,3,2647,Scientific,Medium,Energy drinks are more caffeinated than coffee,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The caffeine content in energy drinks and coffee varies widely depending on the brand and serving size. On average, an 8-ounce cup of coffee contains about 80-100 mg of caffeine. Energy drinks can range from 50 mg to over 300 mg of caffeine per serving, but serving sizes can also vary. Therefore, some energy drinks may be more caffeinated than coffee, while others may not be. The claim is uncertain without specifying particular products or serving sizes."
858,3,2648,Myths,Medium,Red Bull gives you wings,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim ""Red Bull gives you wings"" is a marketing slogan and not meant to be taken literally. Red Bull is an energy drink that contains caffeine and other ingredients intended to increase alertness and energy levels, but it does not physically give a person wings or the ability to fly. The claim is metaphorical, and there is no scientific basis for it being true in a literal sense."
859,3,2649,Scientific,Medium,Sports drinks are necessary for exercise,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Sports drinks are not necessary for most types of exercise. They are designed to replenish electrolytes and provide carbohydrates, which can be beneficial during prolonged, intense physical activity lasting more than an hour. For shorter or less intense workouts, water is typically sufficient for hydration. The necessity of sports drinks depends on the duration and intensity of the exercise, as well as individual needs."
860,3,2650,Scientific,Medium,Chocolate is toxic to humans,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Chocolate contains theobromine, which is toxic to many animals, but humans can metabolize it more efficiently. While consuming extremely large amounts of chocolate could potentially lead to theobromine poisoning in humans, such cases are rare and require consumption far beyond typical dietary amounts. Therefore, chocolate is not generally considered toxic to humans in normal quantities."
861,3,2651,Myths,Medium,Poinsettias are deadly poisonous,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that poinsettias are deadly poisonous is likely false. While poinsettias can cause mild irritation or discomfort if ingested, such as nausea or vomiting, they are not considered deadly. Extensive studies and reports, including those from poison control centers, indicate that poinsettias are not highly toxic to humans or pets. The myth of their extreme toxicity is largely exaggerated."
862,3,2652,Myths,Medium,Swallowing watermelon seeds grows plants in stomach,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,The claim that swallowing watermelon seeds can cause plants to grow in the stomach is a myth. The human stomach is an inhospitable environment for seed germination due to its acidic nature and lack of light and soil. Seeds that are swallowed are typically digested or pass through the digestive system without sprouting.
863,3,2653,Scientific,Medium,Double-dipping spreads bacteria,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Studies, such as one conducted by Clemson University, have shown that double-dipping can transfer bacteria from a person's mouth to the dip. While the amount of bacteria transferred may vary, the act of double-dipping does introduce bacteria into the dip, supporting the claim that it spreads bacteria. However, the extent of bacterial spread and its potential health impact can depend on various factors, such as the type of dip and the individual's oral hygiene."
864,3,2654,Scientific,Medium,Five-second rule is valid,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The ""five-second rule"" suggests that food dropped on the floor is safe to eat if picked up within five seconds. Scientific studies have shown that bacteria can transfer to food almost instantaneously upon contact with a contaminated surface, regardless of the time it remains there. Factors such as the type of surface, the type of food, and the presence of moisture play a more significant role in bacterial transfer than the duration of contact. Therefore, the claim is likely false."
865,3,2655,Scientific,Medium,Washing hands with antibacterial soap is better,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Studies have shown that washing hands with regular soap and water is generally as effective as using antibacterial soap for removing germs and preventing illness. The FDA has stated that there is no significant evidence that antibacterial soaps are more effective than plain soap and water. Additionally, overuse of antibacterial products can contribute to antibiotic resistance. Therefore, the claim that antibacterial soap is better is likely false."
866,3,2656,Scientific,Medium,Hand sanitizer is better than washing,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Hand sanitizer is effective at killing many types of germs, but it is not better than washing hands with soap and water in all situations. Soap and water are more effective at removing certain types of germs, dirt, and chemicals. Handwashing is particularly recommended when hands are visibly dirty or greasy. Hand sanitizer is a good alternative when soap and water are not available, but it does not replace the need for proper handwashing."
867,3,2657,Myths,Medium,You should feed a cold and starve a fever,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The saying ""feed a cold and starve a fever"" is a traditional adage with no scientific basis. Modern medical advice suggests maintaining proper nutrition and hydration regardless of whether one has a cold or a fever. Eating nutritious foods and staying hydrated can support the immune system in both cases. Therefore, the claim is likely false, and my confidence in this assessment is relatively high based on current medical understanding."
868,3,2658,Scientific,Medium,Vitamin C prevents colds,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that vitamin C prevents colds is likely false. Numerous studies have shown that vitamin C does not significantly reduce the incidence of colds in the general population. However, it may slightly reduce the duration and severity of cold symptoms in some people. The evidence does not support the idea that vitamin C can prevent colds outright, leading to a score of 0.3. My confidence in this assessment is high due to the consistency of findings across multiple studies."
869,3,2659,Scientific,Medium,Zinc prevents colds,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that zinc prevents colds is uncertain. Some studies suggest that zinc may reduce the duration and severity of cold symptoms if taken within 24 hours of onset, but evidence on its ability to prevent colds is mixed. The effectiveness can vary based on the form and dosage of zinc used. Therefore, while zinc might have some benefits related to colds, it is not definitively proven to prevent them."
870,3,2660,Scientific,Medium,Chicken soup cures colds,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"While chicken soup is often recommended as a home remedy for colds, there is no scientific evidence that it cures colds. It may help alleviate some symptoms by providing hydration, warmth, and nutrients, and it might have mild anti-inflammatory effects. However, it does not directly cure the viral infection causing the cold."

Medical experts generally recommend maintaining a balanced diet and staying hydrated when sick, regardless of whether one has a fever or a cold. Proper nutrition and hydration support the immune system in fighting infections. Therefore, the claim is likely false, and my confidence in this assessment is relatively high."
872,3,2662,Scientific,Medium,Green mucus means bacterial infection,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The color of mucus, such as green, is not a definitive indicator of a bacterial infection. Green mucus can occur due to the presence of white blood cells and enzymes, which can be present in both viral and bacterial infections. While green mucus can sometimes accompany bacterial infections, it is not a reliable diagnostic tool on its own. Other symptoms and medical evaluation are necessary to determine the cause of an infection."
873,3,2663,Myths,Medium,Going outside with wet hair causes colds,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Colds are caused by viruses, not by being cold or having wet hair. While being cold or having wet hair might make someone feel uncomfortable, it does not cause viral infections. The common cold is primarily spread through contact with infected individuals or surfaces."
874,3,2664,Myths,Medium,Cold weather causes colds,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The common cold is caused by viruses, primarily rhinoviruses, not by cold weather itself. However, cold weather can contribute to conditions that facilitate the spread of these viruses, such as people spending more time indoors in close proximity. Therefore, while cold weather is associated with an increased incidence of colds, it is not the direct cause."
875,3,2665,Scientific,Medium,Flu shot gives you the flu,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the flu shot gives you the flu is definitely false. The flu vaccine is made from inactivated (killed) viruses or a single protein from the flu virus, which cannot cause the flu. Some people may experience mild side effects, such as soreness at the injection site or a low-grade fever, but these are not the flu. This misconception likely arises from the timing of flu-like symptoms coinciding with the vaccination period, but these symptoms are not caused by the vaccine itself."
876,3,2666,Scientific,Medium,Natural immunity is better than vaccine immunity,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""natural immunity is better than vaccine immunity"" is complex and context-dependent. Natural immunity, acquired through infection, can provide robust protection, but it varies significantly among individuals and can come with the risk of severe illness or complications. Vaccine-induced immunity is designed to provide protection without the risks associated with the disease itself and can be more predictable and consistent across populations. Some studies suggest that natural immunity may offer strong protection, but vaccines can enhance and prolong immunity, especially against variants. The effectiveness of natural versus vaccine immunity can depend on factors such as the specific disease, the individual's health, and the presence of virus variants. Therefore, the claim is uncertain and requires more context for a definitive assessment."
877,3,2667,Scientific,Medium,Herd immunity prevents disease spread,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Herd immunity occurs when a significant portion of a population becomes immune to a disease, either through vaccination or previous infections, reducing the likelihood of disease spread. This concept is well-supported by epidemiological evidence, as it can protect those who are not immune by lowering the overall amount of the pathogen in the community. However, the effectiveness of herd immunity depends on factors such as the disease's contagiousness, vaccine efficacy, and population immunity levels. While it can significantly reduce disease spread, it may not completely prevent it, especially if immunity wanes or if new variants emerge."
878,3,2668,Scientific,Medium,Masks don't work,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that ""masks don't work"" is likely false. Scientific evidence supports that masks, particularly well-fitted masks like N95 respirators, are effective in reducing the transmission of respiratory viruses, including COVID-19. Masks primarily work by blocking respiratory droplets that may contain viruses, thereby reducing the spread from infected individuals and offering some protection to the wearer. While the effectiveness can vary based on mask type, fit, and usage, the overall consensus in the scientific community is that masks are a useful tool in controlling the spread of infectious diseases."
879,3,2669,Scientific,Medium,Social distancing prevents disease,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Social distancing is a public health measure designed to reduce the spread of infectious diseases, particularly those transmitted through respiratory droplets, such as COVID-19. Evidence from epidemiological studies and historical data from past pandemics supports the effectiveness of social distancing in reducing transmission rates. However, its effectiveness can vary depending on factors such as compliance, the nature of the disease, and other concurrent public health measures. Therefore, while social distancing is likely to prevent disease spread, it is not an absolute guarantee."
880,3,2670,Scientific,Medium,Quarantine stops outbreaks,TRUE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Quarantine is a public health practice used to prevent the spread of contagious diseases by separating and restricting the movement of people who may have been exposed to a pathogen. Historical and contemporary evidence shows that quarantine can be effective in controlling outbreaks, such as during the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the COVID-19 pandemic. However, its effectiveness depends on timely implementation, adherence by the public, and other concurrent measures like testing and contact tracing. While quarantine can significantly reduce transmission and help control outbreaks, it may not completely stop them without additional interventions."
881,3,2671,Scientific,Medium,Asymptomatic people can spread disease,TRUE,TRUE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"It is well-documented that asymptomatic individuals can spread certain infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Numerous studies have shown that people who do not exhibit symptoms can still carry and transmit the virus to others. This has been a significant factor in the spread of COVID-19, as asymptomatic transmission makes it challenging to control outbreaks."
882,3,2672,Scientific,Medium,COVID vaccine changes DNA,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"COVID-19 vaccines, such as mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) and viral vector vaccines (Johnson & Johnson), do not change or interact with DNA. mRNA vaccines work by instructing cells to produce a protein that triggers an immune response, and they do not enter the cell nucleus where DNA is located. Viral vector vaccines use a modified virus to deliver instructions to cells, but they also do not integrate into the host DNA. Extensive scientific research and regulatory reviews have confirmed that these vaccines do not alter human DNA."
883,3,2673,Scientific,Medium,COVID vaccine was rushed,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,NO,0.50,0.50,"The claim that the COVID vaccine was ""rushed"" is likely true in the sense that the development timeline was significantly shorter than traditional vaccine development processes. Typically, vaccines take years or even decades to develop, but COVID-19 vaccines were developed and authorized for emergency use within about a year. This expedited timeline was due to unprecedented global collaboration, significant funding, and prior research on similar viruses. However, despite the rapid development, the vaccines underwent rigorous testing and regulatory review to ensure safety and efficacy. The term ""rushed"" can imply a lack of thoroughness, which is not accurate in this context, but the timeline was indeed accelerated."
884,3,2674,Myths,Medium,COVID vaccine contains microchips,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that COVID vaccines contain microchips. The ingredients of COVID vaccines are publicly available and do not include any form of microchip technology. This claim has been widely debunked by health organizations and experts.
885,3,2675,Myths,Medium,5G causes COVID,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that 5G causes COVID-19 is definitely false. COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a biological pathogen, whereas 5G is a technology for wireless communication that uses radio waves. There is no scientific evidence linking 5G technology to the spread or cause of COVID-19. This claim has been debunked by numerous health organizations, including the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
886,3,2676,Scientific,Medium,Ivermectin cures COVID,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Multiple studies and reviews have shown that ivermectin is not effective in treating COVID-19. Major health organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), do not recommend its use for COVID-19 outside of clinical trials. While some early studies suggested potential benefits, they were often small, poorly controlled, or later discredited. The consensus in the scientific community is that ivermectin does not cure COVID-19."
887,3,2677,Scientific,Medium,Hydroxychloroquine cures COVID,FALSE,FALSE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Multiple studies and clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19. The majority of high-quality research, including randomized controlled trials, has shown that hydroxychloroquine does not significantly reduce mortality or improve outcomes for COVID-19 patients. Major health organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), do not recommend hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment based on current evidence."
888,3,2678,Scientific,Medium,Sunlight kills COVID,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,NO,0.50,0.50,"Sunlight, specifically ultraviolet (UV) light, has been shown to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus on surfaces under certain conditions. However, the effectiveness depends on factors such as the intensity and duration of exposure, and it is not a reliable method for killing the virus in all situations, especially in the human body. Therefore, while sunlight can contribute to reducing the viability of the virus on surfaces, it is not a standalone solution for controlling COVID-19."
889,3,2679,Scientific,Medium,Bleach injection cures COVID,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that bleach injection cures COVID-19 is definitely false. Bleach is a toxic substance and injecting it into the body is extremely dangerous and can cause serious harm or death. There is no scientific evidence or medical basis to support the idea that bleach can cure COVID-19. Health authorities, including the CDC and WHO, have explicitly warned against using bleach in this manner."
890,3,2680,Controversial,Hard,COVID came from a lab,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The origin of COVID-19 remains uncertain. While the prevailing scientific consensus suggests a natural zoonotic origin, the possibility of a lab-related incident has not been definitively ruled out. Investigations by various organizations, including the World Health Organization, have not provided conclusive evidence for either scenario. The lack of definitive proof for either hypothesis results in an unclear assessment."
891,3,2681,Scientific,Medium,COVID originated in bats,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,47.9%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that COVID-19 originated in bats is likely true based on current scientific evidence. Studies have shown that the closest known relatives of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, are found in bats. However, the exact pathway from bats to humans is not fully understood, and it is believed that an intermediate host may have been involved. While the bat origin hypothesis is widely supported, the lack of definitive evidence for the exact transmission route means there is some uncertainty."
892,3,2682,Scientific,Medium,Pangolins were intermediate host,UNVERIFIED,UNVERIFIED,49.4%,YES,0.50,0.50,"The claim that pangolins were an intermediate host for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, is uncertain. Some studies have suggested that pangolins could have played a role in the transmission of the virus to humans due to the similarity of certain coronaviruses found in pangolins to SARS-CoV-2. However, definitive evidence proving pangolins as the intermediate host is lacking, and other potential hosts have also been considered. The scientific community has not reached a consensus, making the claim unclear."
893,3,2683,Scientific,Medium,COVID is just the flu,FALSE,FALSE,95.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"COVID-19 and the flu are caused by different viruses; COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, while the flu is caused by influenza viruses. They have different transmission rates, symptoms, and potential complications. COVID-19 has shown to have a higher mortality rate and can lead to severe respiratory issues and long-term health effects. Vaccines and treatments for each are also distinct. Therefore, the claim that ""COVID is just the flu"" is definitely false."
894,3,2684,Scientific,Medium,Long COVID is real,TRUE,TRUE,90.0%,YES,0.50,0.50,"Long COVID, also known as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), is recognized by major health organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It refers to a range of symptoms that persist for weeks or months after the acute phase of a COVID-19 infection. Numerous studies have documented the existence of long COVID, detailing various symptoms such as fatigue, cognitive impairment, and respiratory issues. While research is ongoing to fully understand its mechanisms and prevalence, the consensus in the medical community supports the reality of long COVID."
895,3,2685,Scientific,Medium,COVID affects young people minimally,FALSE,UNVERIFIED,49.2%,NO,0.50,0.50,"While young people generally experience milder symptoms and lower mortality rates from COVID-19 compared to older adults, they are not immune to severe outcomes. Some young individuals have experienced significant health issues, including long COVID and, in rare cases, severe illness or death. Additionally, young people can contribute to the spread of the virus. Therefore, the claim that COVID affects young people minimally is likely false, as it oversimplifies the varied impacts of the virus on this age group."
